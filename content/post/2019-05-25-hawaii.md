## Why did we want to travel?

There were a few key reasons for traveling and the vacation in general. First,
my wife completed her Master's program and this was a way to celebrate her amazing
work. Second, unlimited vacation often leads to less vacation than if the number
of paid time off was explicit and if I don't take occasional breaks, I will burn
out. It is also good to step away and consider all that you have accomplished and
assess whether your path is aligning with your goals. Finally, to experience a
place with a different culture than home.

### Why did we choose Hawaii?

If I remember correctly, I suggested that we visit Seattle. My wife, being a
fan of warm and sunny beaches had other places in mind. A friend spoke very highly
of Hawaii, saying that it literally changed his life. He even signed a phone contract
while there to get an 808 area code for his phone. Also, my mom visited Hawaii when
she was young and mentioned it a few times. We never talked about it in detail or
saw pictures. I just talked to my aunt to see if she had any pictures. She couldn't
remember much about my mom's trip either (she didn't go). All that she could remember
was that she visited the [King Kamehameha Statue](https://www.gohawaii.com/islands/oahu/regions/honolulu/king-kamehameha-statue).
Which after a little research doesn't help much because there are four of these statues,
two on the island of Hawaii, one in Oahu and one in Washington, DC. The final reason
was to go somewhere that we could enjoy the beauty of nature. Somewhere that had
beaches as well as mountains, as I wanted to do some hiking. Hawaii is also known
for its Kona coffee. Being a coffee fan, I would be lying if I didn't at least mention
that this influenced my decision a bit.

## Overview of our trip

After booking the trip, I started watching videos on YouTube and one channel that
had great videos and that were super informative with a good description was [Preston and Krista](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkIADRl3jDLuSGmd2O1a23A).
We got a lot of inspiration from these videos, but didn't do everything that they
did and did a few things that they didn't do. I would strongly encourage this as
a starting point and do the things that interest you, but also leave time to adventure
and find parts of Hawaii that are beautiful to you.

This resort was really nice. There were two nice pools (that we did not use) and
an ocean view and walkout. We definitely enjoyed the view in the morning while
getting ready for the day, but only went in the ocean once from the walkout. It was
pretty rocky and didn't have much sand. There was a great yard that had beach chairs
and you could enjoy the sun in those, which we did one evening and read to the beautiful
sound of the ocean waves crashing. Our room was also very nice. There was a loft
with a second bedroom and bathroom that we never used. The bed was also very comfortable
and having a full kitchen was nice.

This resort had a complementary breakfast and informational session on the first morning
that we were there. We knew that they were going to be pitching excursions and we
planned to just go for the free food. The food was actually less than we expected.
It said continental breakfast, but was just a few very small pastries. While the
session was definitely a pitch, the individual did provide a lot of great information
about free activities also e.g., a beach where the sea turtles visited in the
afternoon (which was a highlight of the trip), the banyan tree court where there
were a lot of great shops and restaurants, and pointed out a few beaches that were
definitely worth visiting. Below are our notes from the meeting.

### Kauai - Friday, May 17th - Monday, May 20th

[Preston and Krista's Itinerary Challenge Video](https://youtu.be/8PFW_LqSoJU)

Resort: [Aston Islander on the Beach in Kapaa, Kauai](https://www.aquaaston.com/hotels/aston-islander-on-the-beach)

This resort was not as big or nice as the Aston at Papakea. The room was basically
a hotel room. It still fit our needs as we didn't spend much time at the resort
anyway. The Aston Islander had a single pool and jacuzzi, which we did enjoy one evening.
One thing that was weird about this resort was that we were on the third floor
and there was no elevator in our building, so hauling the luggage up and down was
a slight challenge. We usually only use elevators for luggage transport, so it wasn't
that big of a deal, but this could be a deal breaker for some people.

Both resorts were in great locations, close to restaurants, convenient stores
and short drives to everything --- everything was a relatively short drive since
the islands aren't that large. If I had to estimate the time that we spent in the
car, excluding excursion time (e.g., Hana Highway), we probably spent around 30-45
minutes in the car to get somewhere. The nearest downtowns on both Maui and Kauai --- Lahaina
and Kapaa, respectively were a 10-15 minute drive from the resorts.

Personally, for me, since we did not spend much time at the resort or in the room,
I think we could have stayed somewhere more cost effective. If you planning on just
relaxing at the resort, these would both be good places for doing that.

### Our Tips

If you are looking for tips on bars or nightlife, these tips won't help you as these
aren't things that we are interested in and we were exhausted by 8PM every night.
We did grab a late dinner and walked around the shops around 8PM in Lahaina on Maui
the one evening and it seemed like it did come more alive as the night went on,
but we left after eating.

I'm a big coffee fan and I definitely wanted to check out the cool coffee shops, so
you will see that reflected in the overview of our trip. In Preston and Krista's
video of Kauai, they visited a coffee shop, namely Rainbeau Jo's that looked really
cool and I wanted to try, but after checking out there social media and website, they
are temporarily closed [(something about their landlord or lot lease)](https://www.rainbeaujos.com/the-bay-kauai) while they
build out a more permanent location --- they were a food truck.

+ dont rent a jeep (unless you really want it)
    + there was only one point where I wish we had a jeep (off-road beach)
    + jeep would have made the trip to hana much more difficult
+ honestly, I would suggest renting the smallest, cheapest car
    + most people on maui and kaui drove crappy cars
    + it was actually super easy to pick out locals (drove older nissans and small ranger-like trucks)
      from tourists (drove clean, new mid-tier cars e.g., chevy malibu, ford fusion, etc)
+ the expiditions feel over-priced and tourist-y
    + i understand that people make a living from these businesses and people are willing to pay the price
    + but if you are on the edge about paying it, skip them
    + you can do most things yourself anyway (e.g., road to hana, sunset at haleakala)
+ a lot of the experiences worth doing (in terms of time) are free or very cheap
    + beaches in hawaii are open to the public
    + there was even a beach with green sea turtles (people swimming, nothing that the ranger could do)
    + haleakala hike (\$25 national park fee)
        + this is what we paid
        + http://mauiwatch.com/2018/04/haleakala-national-park-changes-entrance-fees-to-address-infrastructure-needs-improve-visitor-experience/
        + this goes toward covering field trips for kids
        + restoring park trails
        + visitor center improvements (restrooms, parking lots, etc)
        + controlling invasive species
        + definitely worth it and goes to good use
        + I would be willing to pay much, much more (e.g., the price of an excursion)
            + this was cheaper than a single meal
        + actually the receipt allowed you to enter the park for 3 days (road to hana)
    + on kaui some of the trails had minimal fees
        + help preserve the trail
        + keep track of how many visitors
+ just experience it because pictures and videos dont do it justice
    + im not saying dont take pictures, etc., just that unless you are a professional, they arent going to do a great job of displaying the beauty
