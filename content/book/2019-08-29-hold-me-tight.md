abstract: "Hold Me Tight discusses a practice known as Emotionally Focused Therapy or EFT for short. EFT is heavily based on John Bowlby's Attachment Theory. The basis of both EFT and Attachment Theory is the innate need for connections and closeness with others. In Hold Me Tight, author Dr. Sue Johnson discusses EFT in the context of couples with many real world conversations. She also describes how EFT can be a solution for what she calls 'Demon Dialogues' or cyclical arguments where individuals are indirectly demanding each other's attention and love."

## The Knowledge Podcast: Episode #63

I listen to a lot of podcasts and it is from these that I get a lot of my book recommendations.
One of my favorite podcasts is [Farnam Street](https://twitter.com/farnamstreet?)'s
[The Knowledge Project](https://fs.blog/the-knowledge-project/) with [Shane Parrish](https://twitter.com/ShaneAParrish).
I couldn't give a better description of the podcast than the summary on their site.

> The Knowledge Project is a podcast that explores the timeless ideas of how
to better understand yourself, others, and the world around you.

> Together with host Shane Parrish, youâ€™ll uncover the mental models, stories,
and lessons that help you master the best of what other people already know.

It was in episode 63, [Cracking the Code of Love with Dr. Sue Johnson](https://fs.blog/sue-johnson/),
where Shane spoke with Dr. Sue Johnson, the developer of EFT or Emotionally Focused Therapy
and author of Hold Me Tight.
