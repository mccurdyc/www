> Who you are is not the values you list on the wall. It's not what you say in a
company-wide meeting. It's not your marketing campaign. It's not even what you believe.
Who you are is what you do.

## Culture

> ... your culture is how your company makes decisions when you're not there.

> If you don't methodically set your culture, then two-thirds of it will be accidental,
and the rest will be a mistake.

> Companies --- just like gangs, armies and nations --- are large organizations
that rise or fall because of the daily micro-behaviors of the human beings that
compose them.

> Culture isn't a set of magical rules that make everyone behave the way you'd like.
It's a system of behaviors that you _hope_ _most_ people will follow _most_ of the time...
[the] aim is to be better, not perfect.

Culture doesn't guarantee success. But Ben says that employees quickly forget press
releases, quarterly reviews, product definitions, but people never forget what it
was like to work somewhere.

The behavior of the people in an organizations is often due to the culture, not
the people themselves. This was

## Values versus Virtues

Values are aspirations, while virtues are actions. The samurai referred to core
principles as "virtues" rather than "values".

Culture is just as much defined by the "in-actions" as it is by the actions or
virtues. Ben mentions, that in the military, if you see something below standard
and do nothing, then you've just set the new standard. Ben tells a story of Shaka Senghor,
who was in prison for murder. Senghor, when he first arrived in the prison was
in a position where the other prisoners were trying to "figure him out". The other
prisoners were just as much interested in his in-actions as they were his actions.
For example, could someone bully him around without repercussion? New employees
at a company are put in the exact same position as Senghor was in prison. Should
the new employee leave early? Should they call someone out when they do something
unethical? If something is broken, should they say something?

## Leading Culture

As a leader, it is even more important that you embody and strongly believe in
the company values and practice the virtues. But the problem is that most people,
including leaders, don't possess a "supersharp" definition of their personal values.
Ben poses the question, "How do you become the kind of leader that you yourself want
to follow?"

> A hypocrite at the highest level quickly destroys culture.

## A Foundation of Trust

> In any human interaction, the required amount of communication is inversely proportional
to the level of trust.

As an organization grows, communication becomes one of, if not the, most difficult
challenge. If communication can be offset by more trust, then the efficiency of
a smaller organization will remain, rather than decline, as the organization grows.
