# Individual Contributors Should Still Understand Management

{{<tweet 1135881974424358913>}}

> Every engineer should read this.  Not just managers.

Before Charity Majors posted that Tweet, I posted a Tweet making a similar statement.
The other books included in the picture are of a similar genre to An Elegant Puzzle.
This "self-help" genre is one that I most frequently read.

{{<tweet 1134086064514187264>}}

Reading these books enables me to be a knowledgable contributor in the challenging
problems that exist at a fast-growing company. These books have also helped prepare
me for one-on-ones with people at the highest level in the company and frequent
one-on-ones with my manager and managers two and three levels above me.

In the Appendix of An Elegant Puzzle, Will lists books and papers that have been
helpful in his career. One in particular that stood out to me was [The Mythical Man-Month](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959).
More specifically, it was Will's note about why this book was impactful for him.
Will mentioned that this was the first professional book that he had ever read
and that it "opened [his] eyes to the wealth of software engineering literature
waiting out there". The Mythical Man-Month was part of my college Computer Science
curriculum and I have revisited it a few time since. This book had a similar
impact for me i.e., introducing me to a genre of literature that is extremely useful
in my day-to-day life as a software engineer in industry. As shown below in my Tweets,
many of my challenges as a software engineer are not purely technical.

> An organization is a collection of people working toward a shared goal.

Ultimate goal is doing what is best for the company.

## Teams (p 32 & p88)

### Team Sizing

> "this might be the best book I have ever read on engineering teams" and by page 42 I knew for sure.

+ how do you get the teams to the appropriate sizes?
    + hire external
    + shift internal
    + ...

shifting internal is very costly, should avoid
+ pay onboarding costs twice (existing employee yet new member to the team and possibly new hire to fill their old position)

starts the book with this.

### "Gelling" (Section ....)
+ p 39
+ expensive; dont disrupt (unless you absolutely need to)
+ "high performing teams"

### Four States of a Team (Section 1.....)
+ p 37
+ p 51 - stacking small wins

### Managing Engineering Reorgs.

+ p85
    + hard things about hard things also talks about this
    + roll out quickly
+ Two best types of reorgs.
    1. one that solves a structural problem
    2. one that you don't do
+ Only one type of wort reorg.
    1. the one you do to avoid a people management problem (e.g., two employees who argue, etc.)
      + Will actually suggests putting these people closer together because most
      problems are caused due to information lost in communication

## "Model, Document, Share"
p97

## Management

### An Ethical Profession
p127

### Freedom _To_ and Freedom _From_
p101

### Work the Policy; Not the Exceptions
p119

p135
+ engineers should be leading 1:1s

## Career Advancement

### Career Ladder
set expectations

p192

### Performance Reviews

### Levels of Involvement
p93

## Presenting to Senior Leadership (Section 3.13)

p104
+ ive failed at this before, not presenting few, clear goals or action items, but instead
listing a bunch of things that I wanted to see changed or addressed. instead, ishould
have presented a few points very clearl....

## Time Management (Section ....)
+ p111
    not an exhaustive list, but points that were meaningful to me now
    + stop doing things
    + decouple participation from productivity
    + calendar blocking
