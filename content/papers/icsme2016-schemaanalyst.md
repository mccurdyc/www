description: "Data stored in relational databases plays a vital role in many aspects of society. When this data is incorrect, the services that depend on it may be compromised. The database schema is the artefact responsible for maintaining the integrity of stored data. Because of its critical function, the proper testing of the database schema is a task of great importance. Employing a search-based approach to generate high-quality test data for database schemas, SchemaAnalyst is a tool that supports testing this key software component. This presented tool is extensible and includes both an evaluation framework for assessing the quality of the generated tests and full-featured documentation. In addition to describing the design and implementation of SchemaAnalyst and overviewing its efficiency and effectiveness, this paper coincides with the tool’s public release, thereby enhancing practitioners’ ability to test relational database schemas."
