# PhotoVoice

## Negative

It's 5:45AM, my alarm rings, I wake up. It's a misty-dewy morning. I put
on my favorite morning playlist _lofi hip hop music - beats to relax/study to_
by Lofi Girl. I hop in the car and head to Race St. It's peacful, you hear the
birds chirping and the air is cool; a perfect morning to skate. Unfortunately,
on these dewy-cooler mornings, the skate park at the MARC is unskateable. The ramps
are soaked and won't be dry until at least 8AM. The ground is dry even under
the open coverings at Race St. though.
