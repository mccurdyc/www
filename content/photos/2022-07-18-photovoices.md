# PhotoVoice

To read more about what PhotoVoice is and our community project, [see this post](../../posts/2022/05/photovoice).

## Negative

It's 5:45AM, my alarm rings, I wake up. It's a foggy-dewy morning. I put
on my favorite morning playlist _lofi hip hop music - beats to relax/study to_
by Lofi Girl. I hop in the car in hopes to skate before work. It's peacful, you hear the
birds chirping and the air is cool; a perfect morning to skate. Unfortunately,
on these foggy mornings, the skate park at the MARC is unskateable. The ramps
are soaked and won't be dry until at least 8AM. We all know Meadville weather,
it could beautiful one day and raining the next. The ground is dry even under
the open coverings at Race St. though.

## Positive

Look at the opportunities. 1, 2, 3, 4, at least 4 opportunities for shelter at
Race St. I hope these buildings aren't already too far deteriorated to be usable.
Or the ground too taken over by nature that it's unskateable due to large cracks.
We have to move faster.
