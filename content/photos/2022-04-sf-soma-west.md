I went out to SF in April and met co-workers for the first time. It was great!
But I also love adventuring on my own and skateparks have been a new subject for
my photography. I especially love artist parks like Soma West. Here are some of
the photos I took --- on "interval shooting" mode --- while learning to ollie.

It wasn't until I returned from SF and looked at the photos that had been taken
in interval mode that something captured my eye, the sticker or stencil graffiti
of the "three-faced woman" at the top of the pole behind me. At first, I didn't
see the three faces! I thought it was just grafitti of a woman and wasn't until
I looked much closer that I saw just how cool this was.

I decided that I would trace this image in Procreate, add my own flare to it
and use it for a wallpaper on my iPad.
