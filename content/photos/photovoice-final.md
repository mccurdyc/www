If you truly want to align with my vision for this space, [check out these videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc85SZc7Kbo&list=PL9o4z4GEXgfd2vg6LuxhPznD-OLQoO78W).

Do we go toward to light? Or do we let this opportunity fade away? Let's walk toward
a future where our community plays together. A place where we can go to overcome
challenges, together. Where we're surrounded by the history previous generations
and color of the current generation. But, this is all just a dream if we don't
take action as the only things that will grow from this space are weeds.

What do you see here? Do you see a wasteland? Or an opportunity for a beautiful
park that all in our community can enjoy? I see an opportunity for a place where
food trucks park, kids play games and stay active while having fun and parents
socialize building connections in the community.

Nature is taking this space back. It's been a long time since this space has provided
for this community. We are blessed to have such a beautiful and historical space,
yet it provides no current value to our community. I envision kids and adults
alike, physically and mentally challenging each other to skate tricks surrounded
by colorful murals on the beautiful existing masonry. But, this is all just a dream
today as the only things that will grow from this space are the weeds. The buildings
will continue to deteriorate until they need completely demolished at which point
this space will either be completely forgotten or replaced by something new with
much less character.

"Race Street Lumber". If you ask someone who's lived in the community for a while,
they will have a story about how wonderful Race Street Lumber was. This is a
community landmark. People want to get back in this space. They're nostalgic of
it's boom. They don't speak of it's fall.

It’s still a dream, but as I said earlier, I can see through a hole in this fence,
a beautiful opportunity. We can address many problems with this space. We can
become a tourist destination for folks seeking parks, art and historical places.
We could tackle a flooding problem in this area with a skatepark that has proper
drainage. We could have a beautiful fountain that uses this water. We can tell
stories about past generations while current generations influence future
generations. We have an opportunity to make something beautiful.

Building “9”. Look at that concrete. Look at the ceiling height. Feel the opportunities.

This is Race St. today. This could be a space for the community or this could be
the wasteland that it is today. Let's reclaim this space.

When wet, these ramps are like ice. We all know the weather here in Meadville; it
rains and snows more than it doesn't. What do kids have to do in this community
when the weather doesn't permit them to be outside? I can only imagine that in the
best case, they are reading or playing video games and strengthening their imagination.
Sadly, I think it's more likely that they are mindlessly scrolling on TikTok.
Let's enable _our_ kids to be the creators inspiring other kids and communities.
