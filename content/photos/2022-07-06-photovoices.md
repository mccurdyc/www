## What is PhotoVoices?

"Photovoice is a process by which people can identify, represent, and enhance
their community through a specific photographic technique. As a practice based
in the production of knowledge, photovoice has three main goals: (1) to enable
people to record and reflect their community's strengths and concerns, (2) to
promote critical dialogue and knowledge about important issues through large and
small group discussion of photographs, and (3) to reach policymakers."

## Our PhotoVoice Project

Our PhotoVoice project takes place in our 5th ward. 5th ward has been shown in our
community to be a hotspot for 911 calls

## Why Am I Participating?

While I haven't and don't currently live in 5th ward, I have ties to the community.
I spent a lot of time in 5th ward as a kid at my friend's house. As kids, we often
played games with other kids in the community.

Today, we only live a couple miles from 5th ward and often drive across the bridge that
is the primary access route for 5th ward, namely Spring street bridge. As we've
driven along Spring street, the old Race St. lumber yard has caught my eye as
it peaks over the trees. I've been told Race St. lumber has been vacant for almost
20 years. Its beautiful masonry and large lot make it appealing for another community
project that I'm working on, namely the Meadville Skatepark renovation/relocation.

For the skatepark project, I'm interested to find a location that is more accessible
for kids who might not have parents willing to drive them across town to the existing
location. Additionally, the existing location has no cover from the elements, which
makes it unusable during the day in the summer due to the lack of shade and
from October to April due to rain and snow. Finally, dedicated skateparks are the
only location in our town that is legal to skate.

Earlier this year, it was announced that the Crawford County Historical Society
was being offered the property and its buildings as a potential donation. And
that if the donation moves forward and is accepted by the society, the property
potentially could become a museum complex for larger displays of the society's
collections and tourism center.

In my conversations with the mayor where I've discussed an Artistic center for
kids to express themselve through skating and graffiti, she said that Josh Sherretts
seemed potentially interested in some of the space at Race Street to be allocated
to this artistic center/skatepark.

## PhotoVoices

As part of the PhotoVoice project, we are focused on things that could affect
our health (positively and negatively), very generally speaking. Anything from
mental and emotional health to physical health.

At this stage we were tasked with photographing the same subject three times
to identify a positive impact and then another --- although I chose to do the
same --- for a negative health impact in the community. In addition to taking
three photos, we were asked to write 3-5 sentences about what we saw, what we
were thinking and the story we wanted to tell with our photos.

The following are my responses.

### Negatives

The story that I wanted to tell was that we are blessed to have such a beautiful
and historical space, yet it provides no current value to our community. I envision
kids and adults alike, physically and mentally challenging each other to skate tricks
surrounded by colorful murals on the beautiful existing masonry. But, this is all
just a dream today as the only things that will grow from this space are the weeds.
The buildings will continue to deteriorate until they need completely demolished
at which point this space will either be completely forgotten or replaced by
something new with much less character.

### Positives

It's still a dream, but as I said earlier, I can see through a hole in this fence,
a beautiful opportunity. We can address many problems with this space. We can
become a tourist destination for folks seeking parks, art and historical places.
We could tackle a flooding problem in this area with a skatepark that has proper
drainage. We could have a beautiful fountain that uses this water. We can tell
stories about past generations while current generations influence future generations.
We have an opportunity.
