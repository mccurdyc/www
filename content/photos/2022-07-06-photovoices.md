# PhotoVoice

To read more about what PhotoVoice is and our community project, [see this post](../../posts/2022/05/photovoice).

## Negatives

The story that I wanted to tell was that we are blessed to have such a beautiful
and historical space, yet it provides no current value to our community. I envision
kids and adults alike, physically and mentally challenging each other to skate tricks
surrounded by colorful murals on the beautiful existing masonry. But, this is all
just a dream today as the only things that will grow from this space are the weeds.
The buildings will continue to deteriorate until they need completely demolished
at which point this space will either be completely forgotten or replaced by
something new with much less character.

## Positives

It's still a dream, but as I said earlier, I can see through a hole in this fence,
a beautiful opportunity. We can address many problems with this space. We can
become a tourist destination for folks seeking parks, art and historical places.
We could tackle a flooding problem in this area with a skatepark that has proper
drainage. We could have a beautiful fountain that uses this water. We can tell
stories about past generations while current generations influence future generations.
We have an opportunity.
