I like this picture because of the white foreground and backgrounds. It was one
of the first ones I shot this day. I should have take my time and took a few more
shots at this location. There was a chain-link fense in front of me when I took
this shot and my initial thought was to frame the shot through the fence, but
I didn't like how it looked with the 50mm focal lenth. I wish I would have
shot this at _f_8 to get more in focus.
