I love love love love the colors, exposure and focus of this photo. This was
definitely luck and not skill.

Something that I think this photo shows is that at this time in my photography
career, I was heavily using film recipes from [Fuji X Weekly](https://fujixweekly.com/fujifilm-x-trans-iv-recipes/).

I don't enjoy editing photos, so I'd rather get the mood that I want in a JPG
straight out of the camera than spend time in Lightroom. My feelings about film
recipes changed when reviewing photos with family after trips. The added grain
and colors are distracting and deceiving, so I started shooting without recipes
more recently and enjoyed sharing those photos more.

The primary reason that I enjoy photography are the stories and time spent with
family and friends looking through photos and the recipes distract from that.
I still LOVE black and white photos.
