This was my first shoot for someone. I knew it would be dark, but I didn't expect
it to be this dark. I was shooting high iso (10k+), often wide open and with a
slow shutter speed (often 1/15 - 1/30). I didn't have much room to play with.
I wanted to be as inconspicuous as possible, therefore, I didn't want to use a
flash and mostly stayed in one position. I'm not a huge fan of tripods, but if I
shot in this situation again, I'd use a tripod.
