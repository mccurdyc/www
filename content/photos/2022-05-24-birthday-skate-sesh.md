Quiet night at the park. Weather was beautiful and spirits were high after a good
meeting with members of city council to discuss park renovations. Sam was hyped
and Carl came later.

I dropped in a bunch on the infamous "steepest" ramp that everyone tries first
and eats it on. Wanted to rock-to-fakie on the ramp, but didn't. I need to practice
my rock point on the smaller ramp to avoid hanging up. Clean drop-in on the half-pipe
before running home for my birthday dinner. A perfect birthday.
