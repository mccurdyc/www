I've had a few people come to me recently and ask about how to start running
seriously. I'm not an expert by any means, but there is one thing that I have
found that works for me. If you make it easy, you will do it.

The problem is we aren't patient. We want the goal from the start.

Admittedly, I don't listen to my self when it comes to lifting weights and I
ALWAYS do too much too soon and then quit lifting after a few weeks.

If you want to start running and haven't run at all before, this is what I did in 2019
when I couldn't sustain running for more than 1 mile:

- Do 1mi (or shorter, whatever works for you) off and on, walk and jogs (don't run).
    - Keep doing this until you dont need to walk at all and you are jogging for 3-6mi straight
- Once you are to the point where you can jog consistently, do 3mi runs 2 or 3 times a week.
    - Do this for 2-3 months to build a base
- I think at this point you've built the habit, listen to your body. Maybe increase
the distance or frequency.

I've found personally I love running 5mi every single day. I feel much better
when I do. Now, some of these runs are recovery runs and I do take full days off
when I know I shouldn't do a recovery run. I only do 3 hard runs a week. 2 increased
pace runs, 1 increased distance run. The rest are zone 2 active recovery runs.
