A friend asked me how I couldn't enjoy Michael Jackson's music.

It's absolutely not that I don't appreciate it. I think it's great. I think it's revolutionary.
I can enjoy it, _sometimes_. I just don't tend to add Michael Jackson songs to my playlists. Nor
do I ever have days where I think "Oh, I want to listen to Michael today" like I do with many other
artists or genres.

This conversation went deep and touched on who I am and what I believe.

Michael's music is "too happy". I'm not an inherently "happy" or "positive" or "optimistic" person
generally. I absolutely can be, just not inherently. I think things trend toward the negative.

When I tell my friends or co-workers this, they are in disbelief because most people know me as a
very positive, optimistic, "happy go lucky" kind of person. I think most of this comes from my naivety
towards many things.

It's hard to convey what I mean here. I think there are serious and significant improvements to life
i.e., I think life is "better" now than thousands of years ago or even 50 years ago. Less diseases,
better vaccines, better medicine, etc.

Hmm. I think it's better for more people i.e., for the general population. The majority is happier
now. I think --- specifically in regards to some measure of "happiness" --- the extremes or maxima
are decreasing.

Is this because most things have gotten better and easier? So something as simple as finding a meal is no longer
a euphoric experience?

I believe that people are inherently good.

I think there is something non-human related to entropy that causes humans to do evil things. Some
higher-level concept or abstraction --- like "humanity" or "the market" --- that is abstracted enough
to allow us to forget that we are dealing with other humans.

I'm going to read https://fs.blog/entropy/

I'm also not sure that the alternative of 100% perfect order is a system we'd want to live in though. Seems boring.

> Do we have free will or are we experiencing something that was always gonna happen?

I don't know. I tend to believe in partial free will. I think free will is quite complex. I don't believe
we are 100% free, but I believe we are more free than restricted.

I don't know that I believe that the rest of time is going according to some grand plan that was
already defined. Maybe it could be predicted. Maybe there are patterns that makes parts predictable.
I don't believe in a well-defined "plan".

> Are we in a simulation? The multi-verse?

I don't know. I don't find it interesting to think about because frankly I don't care to know. I don't
think I'd want to live during a time where we understand this fabric and therefore could cross universes.

I recognize how small we are in relation to space. Like mindblowingly small.

> Is morality something objective [internal; nature] or is it just an agreed social contract?

Hmm. I hadn't thought of this. Probably more social contract. Probably related to that "abstraction" on top
of humanity that also causes evil.
