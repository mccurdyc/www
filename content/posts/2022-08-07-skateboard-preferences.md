As of now, I've owned the following components. All lists are in order of purchase
date. All of my takeaways are purely subjective and not confident, as I'm sure
my preferences will change as I improve and do different things (e.g., grind,
ride more transition, etc.). Also, spending any more than $200 on a complete setup
seems like too much for me. Most decks that I'm interested in are around $100,
most wheels are around $40 (set), most bearings are around $40 (set) and most
trucks are around $50 (pair). My setups are absolutely not the cheapest setup.
My setups are unnecessarily in the higher-mid tier.

## Decks

Right now, 9"+ feels a bit too big. I felt pretty good on the 8.63" deck.
