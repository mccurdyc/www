## Cameras

I've shot with 4 cameras now, 3 digital 1 35mm film.

- my first camera, fuji x100v acquired Dec 2020.
- Leica M-A film camera acquired in Aug 2021
- traded my sister my x100v in Dec 2021 for her xe4 that i bought her as a college graduation gift
- Leica M240 (I burned a hole in the shutter curtain of my M-A so while in for repair, Leica loaned me an M240).

## Lens

- Leica 50mm summicron Dual range (Aug 2021)
- TTArtisan 90mm/f1.25 (Nov 2021)
- Leica 28mm summicron (Jan 2022)

## Process

- ipad
- lightroom ipad app
  - today, I don't do any editing.
  - On my fuji X cameras, I do sometimes use in-camera "recipes" but I tend to appreciate them less when I go back through images later (e.g., 1 year later I'd much rather see them unedited)
- plug sd card into ipad, import to lightroom, scan through image "upvoting" keepers
- images that I want to post to mccurdyc.dev are copied to a separate album
- filter and delete
- plug in external drive and export album to drive
- Go to my computer, log in to lightroom and download mccurdyc.dev photos and "upload"
them to the site
