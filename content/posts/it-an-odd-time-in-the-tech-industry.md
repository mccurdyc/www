Daily life at work right now doesn't go without mention of AI. Everyone is trying
to make sense of it all. It's undoubtably helpful, but where are we headed? Is
it humanly possible to maintain this pace of change? For how long can we maintain it?

We've seen adoption of the cloud, containers and kubernetes in the last decade.
None of which had the impact or rate of adoption or hype that AI has had in just
two or three years. We've seen AI go from being talked about to being ubiquitously
adopted and marketed in under three years. If you aren't talking about AI, you
are considered dead and unwilling to make changes to make money. Things bend
toward AI marketing.

Where are we headed? Will it burst? Will we ever slow back down? Have we lost the
craft of engineering software? Today, it's about shipping.
