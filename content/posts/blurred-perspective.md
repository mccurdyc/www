A combination of things lately compelled me to write about developing my style.
Something recently just "clicked" after a few years of photography. I feel like
I can finally (SOMETIMES) deliberately capture the image and emotion I see and
feel internally.

The style started to develop as I started shooting more abstractly and stopped
obsessing over perfectly capturing the subject. It's almost as when you allow yourself
more freedom over _how_ you take the shot, the more emotion enters the photograph.

I first experienced the emotion in my own photos when I would just pull the trigger.
It started with flash photos. Quick snaps. Far from perfectly-composed subjects.
There was something emotional and beautiful about these photos. From this point
on I stopped focusing on composition and capturing the subject and focused more
on the physical act of capturing. ==_How_ do I capture the _emotion_ of the moment?==
Not, how do I capture the subject.

First, you must identify the moment's emotion. Is it quiet? fuzzy? exciting? chaos?
peace and calm?

Also, something about the abstractness of a photo leaves personal, emotional
interpretation to the viewer. There's something about the abstractness that
allows the viewer to connect more. The abstractness feels like a memory. It strikes
that same feeling. Memories aren't perfectly clear. Also, these motion-blur
images remind me of what you get when you give a kid a camera.

So much of the emotion of a photo is lost when it is clear.

In my trip to SF, I took this photo. Multiple people picked this specific photo
as their favorite. I, too, had an emotional attachment to this photo. Frankly,
it's a bit more interesting in color because there are strong pops of green and
yellow. I no longer have the original color image. Also, while in SF, I stopped
by the Leica store and Brandon Ruffin's work was being exhibitted and a motion-blur
portrait caught my eye as soon as I walked in the door.

As you can see, after this photo, I started to play more with taking photos
that were deliberately out-of-focus. Admittedly, the motion blur is "stronger",
emotionally, than out-of-focus.

After returning home --- on one of my long treadmill runs to make up for the lack
of running while in SF --- I watched "TURN OFF THE LIGHTS WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE NEED PT 1"
by an inspiration of mine, Austin Augie and the blurred, punchy contrast, black and
white photos struck me. I was going to recreate this style.

Tangentially, it was on this same trip --- in fact this after-work photo-walk --- where
I discovered that I could increase the contrast of the "Leica Film Simulation".
