Tech when shadowing a mentor in 2013 felt different. It felt fun. It felt light. It didn't feel solely focused
on efficiencies. It felt fresh, lively, spacious and like a sustainable career.

Still upon starting my professional career in 2017, language communities felt fun and alive.

COVID changed things. What used to be chill turned scared and desparate. Always feeling like it wanted
more. Nothing was ever enough. More, faster, better and more efficiently.

But why?

Will it ever be fun again? Will the pressure lift? Will we have afternoons of bonding with our colleagues?

Is the issue tech? Personal? Remote? Society? Politics?
