I purchases two boards from Powell Peralta on February 21, 2022. They arrived a
few days later. And a few hours after that, I was in the ER with a minor concussion.

## Why Though? Why Now?

Skating was something that I always wished I had done as a kid and I'm not getting
any younger and falls won't get any easier or less hurtful. Also, photography
has become a big part of my life in the last year and skate parks often have an
artsy vibe that I can really appreciate. It's mentally and physically challenging.
It forces you to just do and not think. And it's something to do wherever I go. A
way to explore places and meet locals.

## Progress

The first month was pretty brutal. Falling a lot and not doing much. Struggled
a lot with just pushing around continuously on flat ground. Going up my first ramp
and getting the feel for the necessary shift of balance was really hard. Now,
two months in, I'm getting more comfortable on ramps, starting to learn how to ollie
and can pump on the half-pipe.
