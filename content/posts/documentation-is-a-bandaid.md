The following came to mind when I inherited an old system and was asked to make
significant changes to the system. I wanted to build my mental model up from a
source of truth and I didn't trust the docs.

Admittedly, not all documentation is a bandaid. You need some docs. But when you
need extensive documentation it's because processes or architecture is no intuitive
or accessible.

- treat docs as breadcrumbs rather than sources of truth.
- systems should be built and have tooling so that you dont need docs
