## Why Photography?

I bought my first camera on December 28th, 2020. The primary reason for getting
into photography at first was because I was trying to go without a phone --- just
an iPad --- and while on a trip to Cabo I experienced just how bad the iPad camera
was and how many things I wanted to photograph.

## Which Camera?

I knew very little about photography at this time --- heck when I got the camera,
I didn't know how to take a photo with autofocus --- but I knew that I wanted to
invest in a camera that would be good for traveling and everyday carrying. I
wanted it to be a camera that would clearly surpass the quality of an iPhone.
I also knew that I wanted to use a prime len to force myself to move around and
would be smaller and easier for everyday carrying.
I also knew that I didn't want to be spending a significant amount of time
editing photos. Primarily because the only computers that I have are
Linux machines and they aren't as well supported as Macs or Windows for photo
editing. It wasn't until much later that I figured out that you could use
Lightroom on the iPad.

## Fuji x100v

At the time, I was not aware of the x100v's
ability to apply "filters" or "recipes" to the JPGs in-camera. However, I did
know that the x100v was recognized for it's JPG quality. Also, I wanted something
manual that forced me to understand the deep fundamentals of photography as I was
looking for something outside of tech to go deep on.

After only about a month of shooting with the x100v, I went crazy with JPG recipes.
I was hooked on photography. Watching tons of YouTube videos while running on the
treadmill to learn every detail about my camera's cabilities and how to shoot
like photographers that I was now starting to enjoy their style. The first photography
YouTube channel that I followed was [Faizal Westcott's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTsvuq1quT9ZC_-uac6dc4Q).
I love his style and he used a similar camera. I also knew that a Go programmer
that I looked up to --- Fatih Arslan --- loved the Fuji lineup. I specifically
recall this tweet by Fatih that hooked me.

Months went by, I traveled with the camera, ran with the camera and took it everywhere
I went. I certainly taught me a ton about photography and I can say that I
"grew into" this camera. I knew nothing when I started and this camera helped me
mature into a photographer that understand the manual bits of photography much deeper.
I grew so quickly in photography that I was ready for more. I loved sharing my photos
with my in-law's and it was during one of these conversations that my father-in-law
gave me his old Pentax K1000 35mm film camera. I was pretty convinced that I didn't
want to shoot film. But when I picked up the SLR and looked through the lens to
do focusing, cranked that film advance lever and pushed the shutter, wow was I hooked.

## 35mm Film

I started following channels on YouTube
([Vuhlandes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCla3VF8y6VixwulHEHZ9MQQ),
[Benj Haisch](https://www.youtube.com/user/BenjHaisch),

[Chris Chu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfnLAcg3SzXuxBabWBoApA),
[Justin Mott](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4cwfSfapW2uLCXGGmQFR4g),

[Willem Verbeeck](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIvTu9cuf-NZFzHPJZPH23Q))
and trying to replicate that film look on my x100v --- it was never perfect, it's
certainly very good. A lot of the people's style that I enjoyed were shooting with
Leica. This was when I was first introduced to Leica and yeah... So at this time
I was still loving film, so I was looking for a 35mm Leica film camera. Actually,
I was looking for a Canon P range finder camera. We had a trip planned to Boston
in August of 2021 and I realized they had a Leica store.

I had done quite a bit of research before going and had my eye on the Leica M-A
because it is a 35mm rangefinder film camera that is still produced and it is
totally manual with no electronics --- i.e., no light sensor. I wanted
a challenge and to learn how to meter light without a meter. I almost didn't visit
the Leica store because I expected to get laughed at, but the manager, Jarrett,
was super nice. He let me try out anything I wanted. I got to hold a Leica for
the first time and it was the M-A. He said he had a used M-A manufactured in 2020
and a Leica 50mm Summicron Dual-Range. We visited the Leica store early in the trip
and I thought about it all week. We got home, I thought about it for another week
and I ended up buying the M-A and 50mm Summicron DR.

## My M-A

I loved the M-A. I was pretty much exclusively shooting film at this time. I was
taking my M-A everywhere! It wasn't getting any special treatment. It's got some
wear marks and had a janky strap that I made and love. Because I took it everywhere,
I would leave it on the kitched counter so that I could quickly grab it before leaving
the house. However, this lead to the [shutter curtain being burnt](https://transienteye.com/2015/02/13/leica-shutter-curtain-burn-and-repair/).
I kept shooting for a while because I bought my own chemicals to develop the film
on my own and the kit could process about 24 rolls. I developed my own film in October
and was so sad to see that so many of the rolls had a bright white spot. It took
me about another week of Googling to feel confident this was the issue. I contacted
Leica and sent it in for repair. If I didn't have a warranty ($1600!! for the repair)
and I was originally quoted 4-6 weeks on the repair because it had to be sent to
Germany. It's 10 weeks now and the new estimate is 16 weeks. At about 4 weeks
Leica customer service offered me an M240 as a loaner. I took the offer.

## Back to Digital

At this time, it was hard for me to get excited about shooting film on anything
other than my M-A, so I went back to digital, specifically my x100v. I missed the
feeling of focusing my 50mm Summicron DR. A completely different feeling than
the lose feeling of the autofocus-able x100v. In April, my sister graduated college
and she had been wanting a camera for years, so I got her the new Fuji xe4 as
a graduation gift and the 23mm *f*/2.8 "pancake" lens. I convinced my sister to
trade me while she was home for Christmas so that I could use an adapter on the
xe4 with my 50mm Summicron DR. I thoroughly enjoyed this! I took this to NYC
after Christmas and shot without recipes. I was pretty happy! But it was now
that I learned that I was less in love with the Fuji crop sensor. I wanted my
50mm lens to be 50mm, not 75mm!

## Leica M240 (loaner)

Okay so I had the M240 for a few week at this point. I tried using it the first
day I got it and was pretty disgusted. There was a "movie" button that I kept
hitting. The LCD screen was absolutely TERRIBLE!!! The settings were pretty
confusing and the back buttons are not intuitive. There is an "Info" button that
everyone I've asked "how would you hit 'OK' says they'd hit that button", myself
included. And the "M bottom" has zero function and is super annoying. I looked
at the M10 and while it addressed a couple things, it didn't address enough to get
me interested in a digital Leica (and it wasn't USB-C). I put the M240 down and
didn't use it for a while again. I heard that the M11 was coming and rumors seemed
to address all(!?) of the things I hated about the M240. Also around this time (January
2022), my wife and I went on a day trip to Lake Erie and I took the M240. Not
because I wanted to give it another shot, but because [I had just watched a phenomenal
YouTube video on lens focal lenths](https://youtu.be/p_Szcnr8klA) and I wanted
to use my M-mount lenses to experiment.

## Leica M11

After the rumors were confirmed that they fixed everything wrong, in my opinion,
with every digital Leica to date, I pre-ordered the M11. Now, this is by no means
a cheap or even reasonably-priced camera. But it's exactly what I wanted in a camera.

Leicas hold their value and got me planning how I could pay for this thing. In 2022,
I'm going to work on building my portfolio and try to start making money from
photography by shooting some sessions.

## My Current Editing and Storage Process

The primary goal is to not use a computer and to not edit photos as much as possible.

### Editing/Storage Tools

- iPad Air 4th Generation
- Lightroom iPad app
  - I rarely edit.

I plug an SD card into iPad, import to lightroom and scan through all of the images
on the card, "upvoting" keepers. Images that I want to post to mccurdyc.dev are
copied to a separate album and keepers will get downloaded to an external drive
and non-keepers are deleted.
