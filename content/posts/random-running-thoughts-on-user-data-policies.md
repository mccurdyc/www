I understand there is a monetary pressure to keep user data. If the US doesn't do
it, folks will start using sites that aren't governed by the US.

How do we protect our citizens in a global space? Is it GDPR-like?

I feel like GDPR is great, but it could go one-step further.

Sites should give users the ability to purge all data stored about them. Honestly,
I'd like if it got to the point where users could choose which data to purge so
that this was used more frequently.

What do we suggest to people trying to quit drugs? We tell them to change their
environment. Move to a new city. How do you do that with the internet or social
media sites? You don't. You try to delete the app, but every time you re-install
it's right where you left it; same recommendations, etc.
