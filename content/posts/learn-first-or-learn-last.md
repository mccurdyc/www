Do I spend my time learning the latest and greatest abstraction so that I can apply it in my day-to-day? Or, do I
learn first principles to challenge the abstractions?

I'm torn. Both have value; but time is extremely limited.

Ultimately, I think it boils down to enjoyment. Which brings more joy and excitement to continue learning tomorrow?

Additionally, one has more applicability now and enables you to help others now, while the other is more personal.

Today, I choose the personal path.
