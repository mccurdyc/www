This post is not going to walk through solutions

For this, check out Filippo's Videos

Why do I do them

* Think about something that I don't think about in my day-to-day
* Dive into parts of a language that I don't often use in my day-to-day
* Practice API design
  * Some of the  problems are deliberately designed to build on each other
* Learning a new language (e.g., in my case Rust)
  * This also helps with learning package design in a new language (e.g., in my case Rust)
    * Rust has modules, etc...
  * Learning how to unit test in a language
