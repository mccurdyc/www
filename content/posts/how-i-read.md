## Goals of reading for me

- effeciency of gaining knowledge. I saw somewhere (https://hermanschaaf.com/how-i-choose-nonfiction-books/) mention how we are generally only able to read about X number of books in a lifetime
  - https://hermanschaaf.com/how-i-choose-nonfiction-books/
  - 70-65 (retirement) = 5 years of retired reading. I think ~1/w (52*5) = 260
  - 65-26=39*~15=585 books per year (I read a lot of tech books that I don't post on here I want to)
  - ~850 books in my lifetime

- effectively retaining what I read and being able to quickly "re-read" or reference learnings from a book
  - sharing knowledge
- enjoyment

It is a balance of these three things and they do compete with each other.
The most effecient way for me to read and take notes is reading on the Kindle App
on my iPad and exporting my raw highlights to my notes, but this isn't as enjoyable
for me as a physical book.

## My process

1. while reading a book, I will highlight things.
  - So many books now have so much "fluff" to meet publisher requirements that I view
  my highlighting more as stripping away the fluff. I want to be able to re-read
  a book by reading my highlights and if I want more context, I can go back and read a particular part of a book
  - In physical books, if there is a particular highlight that I don't want to miss
  when writing my post on my site, I will fold the corner of the page.
  - Although, for most reading recently, I've been prioritizing enjoyment. Therefore,
  I've just been highlighting during reading and not taking summarizing or personal
  notes as much and then after finishing a book, I flip through the pages and read
  my highlights and write a rough first pass of a post for my site and then will
  revise, revisit hightlights, etc.

1. iPad is either used for highlighting in digital books or for handwritten notes in GoodNotes for physical books
  - Key apps
    - GoodNotes for physical notes, PDF highlighting (for reading papers)
      - Primarily chose GoodNotes at the time because you could search handwritten text
    - Readwise for syncing Kindle and browser highlights to my "personal database" which was Notion, but is now Obsidian (thanks Jon F.!)
      - For syncing Kindle highlights on the iPad to Readwise, [I use this process](https://help.readwise.io/article/30-how-do-i-import-highlights-from-personal-documents-on-kindle) after finishing a book.
      - It's great because there is an [official Readwise-Obsidian sync plugin](https://help.readwise.io/article/125-how-does-the-readwise-to-obsidian-export-integration-work) and it allows you to format the markdown for highlights which makes it super efficient to then copy to a static site generator that uses markdown like Hugo (what I use)
    - Obsidian
      - I use this for all of my personal typed note taking
      - ideas, todos, note highlights, etc. I love it.
      - I switched from Notion for two reasons:
        - Better markdown support not the quirkly Notion rich text format
        - I wanted to own my data
    - Oreilly's Safari Books Online (for tech books)
      - I make all of my highlights public and [follow this process](https://help.readwise.io/article/116-how-do-i-import-highlights-from-oreilly-learning) for syncing to Readwise after finishing a book.
        - This sucks a bit because results are paginated and you have to email results. I had a little bash script for paginating through results and downloading and then just manually emailed.
          - I haven't improved my process here yet. I've mostly relied on leaving my highlights on Oreilly's platform as public.
          - I don't want to rely on this because they "own" my highlight data and if I decide to stop paying for a subscription, "whoosh" highlights gone.

1. Physical notebook rarely used now other than when I'm seeking more enjoyment
  - I will still use a physical notebook if I want to slow down a bit more and enjoy my fountain pens.

1. Posting to mccurdyc.dev/books (Hugo - markdown static site generator)
- I will try to cut as much as possible to make this fairly concise since this is
mostly for sharing with others and therefore, I optimize for trying to get right
to the point.
- If there is a book that I either didn't enjoy that much (usually I'll stop reading it)
or didn't have the time to invest in reducing my highlights, I'll post all of my
highlights verbatim.
- Why don't I just publish Obsidian pages?
  1. I don't pay for [Obsidian's Publish feature](https://obsidian.md/publish)
  1. I don't want to trim my raw highlights

## The evolution of my process

- before I had an iPad, I took my notes in a physical notebook with my beloved fountain pens
  - for the most part, my notes were quotes verbatim from a book i.e., essentially highlights
  - I would also highlight in the book, but these were the things that really stood out
  - this made it really easy to write a summarizing post on my site with key takeaways.
  - which is another thing. Summarizing my notes had the benefit of helping me internalize
  my takeaways from a book, but it is more time consuming than puting verbatim notes.
  Therefore, I tend to push off writing a post after reading a book (for [Enlightment Now](../books/enlightenment-now.md) I didn't write
  the post until like 5-months later for a couple reason. Primarily, because I read this
  book on vacation, I prioritized enjoyment of the read and therefore didn't write
  notes at all, only highlighted in a physical book which made writing a summarizing post
  much more difficult.), which is worse than not including verbatim notes because I
  can't share a quick summary of my takeaway or revist them myself very quickly.
  Also, I end up leaving a lot out of my post because sections or takeaways just don't
  fit with the flow of the summarizing post. Now, I will do a bit of summarizing and verbatim
  notes.
- Taking physical notes while reading books was what really helped me fall in love
with reading because I could refer to my takeaways really easy in future conversations with
people. I started doing this _after_ college, when I lived alone in Detroit and
was looking for a way to learn how to learn and spend my free time.

## What about audiobooks? Or podcasts?

To be honest, I've only briefly tried audiobooks. Because while they are
super effecient to get through a book, it's much harder to take notes because
you often aren't focused on reading when you are listening to an audiobook or podcast,
you are trying to multi-task --- wether it be while mowing, running, vacuuming, etc. ---
and as soon as I identify something I want to note down and I am trying to keep it
summarized in my head to write down, I don't focus on the rest of the content and
I get mad when I try to fumble around to write it down quickly while mowing, etc.
It just doesn't work for me.

For a short bit for podcasts I used [Airr](https://twitter.com/AirrAudio). I don't remember
why I stopped using it.

I also haven't listened to as many podcasts now that I work remote and don't drive 10h a
week back-and-forth to Detroit. At that time in my life, I burned through so many podcasts.
