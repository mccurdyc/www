A boy sits alone. Seeking hope and joy. While at one
point, less than a decade ago, both hope and joy came from one facet; his career in
tech. He didn't even have to search or put any effort to derive meaning or hope or joy; it was
just there, and welcoming.
But his career no longer brings the joy it once did. Is it him or is it the industry? Or
just the time in which he lives?
Is it the time we live? Optimizing every last bit of everything. Squeezing the type-2
"fun" out of everything. What are we maximizing efficiency for? To free ourselves up
to do what? Or go where? Mars? What for? To do it all over again?

Why can't we enjoy what we have? Here. What if our purpose _is_ exploration? Is
efficiency in one domain to free us in another? Maybe it is. But as an individual who
only experiences one domain that "freedom" in another domain is never felt. It's a
pyramid of power. And to climb the ranks you sacrifice your ability to connect and
be human.

The world isn't inherently bad. It's actually quite beautiful. And we should feel
fortunate that we were born into a place that permits individual freedom (to "Us").
I won't be killed for going outside without permission. Or just going for a drive
without a purpose. I am permitted to just experience what the world has to offer.
But this is a privilege. A privilege that not everyone has.

We are undoubtedly in a better place than even 50-years ago. More free and safe than
before. Is it just incremental? Is it a problem that spans many generations?

Why can't everyone be free?

Is freedom a "good" thing? Are we, as humans, meant to be free? If not, then none of
us should be more free than others. But then, who rules? This is where religion busts
down the door and proclaims, "I'm here".

If religion isn't your ruler and you don't have a human ruler, _you_ are your ruler.
This puts the burden to derive meaning from the undefined on the boy who sits alone.
