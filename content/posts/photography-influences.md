- [Martin Parr](https://www.martinparr.com/introduction/)

I like Parr's focus on leisure in everyday life because this is what defines us
as individuals. It's more the concept that I'm a fan of. I'm not as much as
fan of the style of his work.

> [Parr's photos] show us in a penetrating way how we live, how we present ourselves
> to others, and what we value. - [website](https://www.martinparr.com/introduction/)
