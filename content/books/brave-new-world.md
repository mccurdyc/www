Image a factory staffed by Alphas --- that is to say by separate and unrelated individuals of good heredity and conditioned so as to be capable (within limits) of making a free choice. ... An Alpha-decanted, Alpha-conditioned man would go mad if he had to do Epsilon Semi-Moron work. ... Each one of us, of course ... goes through life inside a bottle. But if we happen to be Alphas, our bottles are, relatively speaking, enormous. ... You cannot pour upper-caste champagne-surrogate into lower-caste bottles. ...
