## Preface

- resolve the problem of suicide
- it is legitimate and necessary to wonder whether life has a meaning
- even if one does not believe in God, suicide is not legititmate
- even within the limits of nihilism it is possible to find the means to proceed beyond nihilism
- "A lucid invitation to live and to create..."

p.2 - O my soul, do not aspire to immortal life, but exhaust the limits of the possible.

p.3 - There is but one truly philosophical problem, and that is suicide...Galileo, who held
a scientific truth of great importance, abjured it with the greatest ease as soon as
it endangered his life... That truth was not worth the stake.

p.4 - I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that
give them a reason for living (what is called a reason for living is also an excellent
reason for dying).

p.5 - killing yourself amounts to confessing. It is confessing that life is too much
for you or that you do not understand it.

p.10 - The real effort is to stay there, rather, in so far as that is possible,
and to examine closely the odd vegetation of those distant regions. Tenacity and acumen
are privileged spectators of this inhuman show in which absurdity, hope, and death
carry on their dialogue.

p.13 - Weariness comes at the end of the acts of mechanical life, but at the same time
it inaugurates the impulse of consciousness. It awakens consciousness and provokes what
follows.

p.13 - Mere "anxiety" ... is at the source of everything

p.14 - the absurd

p.17 - Understanding the world for a man is reducing it to the human, stamping it with
his seal. The cat's universe is not the universe of the anthill.

p.19 - stop trying to understand everything. Stop trying to reduce it to something human

p.19 - This very heart which is mine will forever remain indefinable to me. Between
the certainty I have of my existence and the content I try to give to that assurance,
the gap will never be filled. Forever I shall be a stranger to myself.

p.20 - I have peace only by refusing to know and to live...this world is absurd

p.20 - just live. trust the process.

p.26 - turning every idea [or thought] ... into a privileged moment

p.30 - absurdity springs from comparison... It lies neither of the elements compared;
it is born of their confrontation... the Absurd is not in man ... nor in the world, but in
their presence together.

p.31 - the absurd is essential

p.31 - a man is always prey to his truths. Once he has admitted them, he cannot free
himself from them.

p.32 - Does not the failure reveal, beyond any possibile explanation and interpretation,
not the absense but the existence of transcendence?

p.33 - the absurd becomes god.

p.40 - intelligence must sacrifice its pride and the reason bow down. But if I recognize
the limits of reason, I do not therefore negate it, recognizing its relative powers.

p.41 - If man had no eternal consciousness...what would life be but despair?

p.42 - by trying to find meaning, we find meaning.

p.51 - I can refute everything in this world surrounding me that offends or enraptures
me, except this chaos, this sovereign chance and this divine equivalence which springs
from anarchy. I don't know whether this world has a meaning that transcends it. But I know
that I do not know that meaning and that it is impossible for me just now to know it.
What can a meaning outside my condition mean to me?

p.53 - He is asked to leap... he does not want to do anything but what he fully understands.

p.53 - It was previously a question of finding out whether or not life had to have a meaning
to be lived. It now becomes clear, on the contrary, that it will be lived all the better if
it has no meaning. Living an experience...

p.54 - The theme of permanent revolution is thus carried into individual experience. Living
is keeping the absurd alive.

p.55 - That revolt gives life its value.

Be different! Be absurd!

p.55 - It is essential to die unreconciled and not of one's own free will. Suicide
is a repudiation.
