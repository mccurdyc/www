Founding father of virtual reality, [Jaron Lanier](http://www.jaronlanier.com/), writes
in the introduction about what "nerdism" is like. Lanier says,

> "Life becomes a problem-solving activity, and the problem is some sort of lack of optimization."

He also mentions that computers have this uncanny ability to create the illusion
that we are all-seeing. This immediately made me think about how social media
has the ability to polarize groups of users, especially in regards to American politics. [This
post](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/is_social_media_driving_political_polarization)
from the Greater Good Magazine, explains that the polarization may be subtler than
we think, but major social media sites are not actively working to "bridge" the
polarized groups, to fix the problem.

As software engineers, we have a lot of power and with that comes a lot of responsibility.
However, sometimes lives or data companies are responsible for is not handled with
the appropriate care. Think of the [recent issues with Boeing's best-selling, 737, planes](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/boeing-readies-software-fix-for-737-max-planes-airlines-prepare-for-longer-disruptions.html)
where the software has actually caused the planes to crash in an attempt to
keep the planes from stalling or the [Equifax breach in 2017](https://www.ftc.gov/equifax-data-breach)
where sensitive personal information of 143 million Americans was exposed. Some
of this could be due to strict deadlines to ship imposed on software engineers or
the lack of understanding or care by engineers about what they are actually building.

Ullman describes the typical thought of how software is created, that is, via a
"black-box", where software is magically produced. "Then it moves to programming."
As software engineers, sometimes we are too caught up in _how_ we build something,
instead of _what_ we are building. Ullman says,

> It has occurred to me that if people really knew how software got written, I'm not
> sure if they'd give their money to a bank or get on am airplane ever again.

Ullman also mentions that in general the culture around building software is to make
money, not to solve "real", social problems. And that when we do build software to
solve social problems, we force users to conform to how we think the problem should
be solved instead of talking to the users of the software. We, as software engineers,
are obsessed with problem solving and therefore think we can come up with a better
solution, sometimes without talking to the end-users.

Software systems force users to conform to a limited set of defined options by the
owners of the systems, e.g., male, female.

As software engineers, we take the malfunctioning of software as personal slight,
cursing at the engineers before us who wrote the broken code that we have now
inherited. "How could you be so blind?".

This is something recently that I have talked
about with peers. While a system may be poorly written or buggy --- are you sure it's
a bug and wasn't a feature at that time? --- you have to consider when it was written.
The constraints, the pressures, the discussions and resources available. While
many of these things should be documented, that is not always feasible or seen as
a good use of time when making the decisions. You, as the creator of future loathed
code, need to defend your future self. The blame should not be put entirely on you,
just because you are the name in the commit log.

Something that I have already had to fight with is individuals or groups of individuals
who are attached to a single technology, wanting to use it as a universal solution,
even when there are much better alternatives.

Ullman says when discussing attachment to a single technology, "Don't get comfortable, don't
get too attached, don't get married. Fidelity in technology is not even desirable.
Loyalty to one system if career-death."

Finally, the following paragraph resonated with me, where Ullman describe the life
of a software engineer, we are "never not working".

> Even when I'm not actually doing something that could be called work, I might get
> started any minute. So everything is an interruption --- a call from a friend,
> an invitation to lunch --- everything must be refused because it is possible that
> from one moment to the next I will get back to something.
