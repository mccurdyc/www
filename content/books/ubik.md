p9 - "Resurrection Day - the holiday on which the half-lifers we publicly honored."

p10 - "I'll will my heirs to revive me one day a century... have his body taken out of cold-pac"

p16 - "Is this worth it? he asked himself. Is this better than the old way, the direct road full-life to the grave?"

p16 - "How did it feel, he wondered, to be in half-life? ... the half-life experience was real and it had made theologians out of all of them."

p19 - Why do we talk to God?

p28 - "The door refused to open. It said, 'Five cents, please.' 'Look in the purchase contract you signed when you brought this conapt.'

p30 - "To the girl, Joe Chip said, 'They don't know you have a counter-talent?'... I just negate somebody else's ability."

p31 - "you're a life form preying on the Psis, and the Psis are life forms that prey on the Norms ... 'Which psi talent does it counteract?' ... 'Precog'"

p32 - "precog sees a variety of futures, laid out side by side like cells in a behive... The anti-precog makes all futures seem equally real to the precog."

p32 - "Pat controls the future; that one luminous possibility is luminous because she's gone into the past and changed it. By changing it she changes the present, which includes the precog... she can cancel out the precog's decision _after he's made it_."

p126 - differing perceptions of the world. "all this is going on within me, and yet I seem to see it outside. Strange, he thought. Is the whole world inside of me? Engulfed by my body?"

p127 - "JUMP IN THE URINAL AND STAND ON YOUR HEAD. I'M THE ONE THAT'S ALIVE. YOU'RE ALL DEAD."

p128 - "We're in half-life... killed _us_, not Runciter."

p134 - "One invisible puff-puff whisk of economically priced Ubik banishes compulsive obsessive fears that the entire world is turning into clotted milk, worn-out tape recorders and obsolete iron-cage elevators, plus other, further, as-yet-unglimpsed manifestations of decay.
You see, world deterioriation of this regressive type is a normal experience many half-lifers, especiially in the early stages when ties to the real reality are still very strong."

p136 - "He felt all at once like an ineffectual moth, fluttering at the windowpane of reality, dimly seeing it from outside."

p138 - "The man contains --- not the boy --- but earlier men"

p162 - An aerosol spray can... There's a Latin word very close to it: _ubique._ It means --- 'Everywhere'"

p184 - "An orientation urging him toward death, decay and nonbeing"

p208 - "Behind Jory there is nothing; he is the end."
