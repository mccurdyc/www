This was an easy read to get into vacation mode. I can't say that I "enjoyed" it,
but it was a decent story. It definitely created a clear visual story for me. I
didn't have to think, I could just read and the book did the work for me.

The message I got from it was about finding what is meaningful and brings you joy
when you are in a place where you can't easily find those things. Don't be afraid
to do the things that bring you joy even when you should be "grinding" instead.
