### General Remarks

I enjoyed reading this book on vacation, but I don't think it strongly represents
what makes David Foster Wallace's writing unique. Probably because it is
DFW's first novel that he wrote while he was still a master's student. I don't
think he had yet discovered what made his writing unique. The content and themes
were interesting and good, just the writing style didn't scream DFW which is what
I enjoyed so much about [Infinite Jest](https://www.mccurdyc/dev/books/infinite-jest).
I honestly thought I was reading a Pynchon novel.

inside you?" [p 104]
  - we are in control of what possess meaning in life.
