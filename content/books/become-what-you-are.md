- You may believe yourself out of harmony with life and its eternal Now; but you cannot be, for you are life and exist Now.”—from Become What You Are ([Location 17](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=17))
- to “become what you are” is at once an impossible directive and an unavoidable fact. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=95))
- the linguistic problems posed by expressing that variety of knowledge in words. ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=120))
- the highest to which man can attain is wonder; and if the prime phenomenon makes him wonder, let him be content; nothing higher can it give him, and nothing further should he seek for behind it; here is the limit. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=123))
- a mechanism, ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=136))
- out of the union between self and life (or the world) there is born the Christ, ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=139))
- for no two opposites can exist unless there is a relation between them. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=141))
- right. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=147))
    - Note: Right according to the masses? Dead and not willing to fight for what may be considered wrong?
- a man does not really begin to be alive until he has lost himself, ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=155))
- released the anxious grasp which he normally holds upon his life, his property, his reputation and position. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=155))
- “holy poverty,” ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=156))
- because all is lost—there is nothing to lose, ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=157))
- But most of us know that we will not, and probably cannot do it—that we shall continue to cling to our habitual ways of life with all the helplessness of addicts to a destroying passion. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=164))
- I said at the beginning that the words about finding one’s life through losing it were not really a precept that could simply be practiced and obeyed. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=166))
- transcending the ego ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=167))
- Always have a large pinch of salt handy when you meet the fellow who talks about trying to renounce himself, to overcome his ego. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=168))
- Some of us will always be trying—with an exasperating degree of relative success—to improve ourselves in one way or another, and no amount of self-acceptance will stop it. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=180))
- We are really stuck with ourselves, and our attempts to reject or to accept are equally fruitless, ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=186))
- The part of our self that wants to change our self is the very one that needs to be changed; but it is as inaccessible as a needle to the prick of its own point. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=188))
- Thus the one important result of any really serious attempt at self-renunciation or self-acceptance is the humiliating discovery that it is impossible. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=193))
- In this metaphorical sense, the ego dies on finding out its own incapacity, its inability to make any difference to itself that is really important. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=195))
- worn as the proud badge of graduation. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=200))
- Thus one of the more sickening aspects of spiritual phoniness is the usually rather subtly hinted implication that one has, after all, “suffered so much.” ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=201))
- effectively convinced that it cannot be done. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=203))
- I have always found that the people who have quite genuinely died to themselves make no claims of any kind to their own part in the process. They think of themselves as lazy and lucky. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=204))
- a strong will and a clever head makes some things very difficult to see. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=207))
- trying to pretend to oneself that a life of constant self-frustration was in fact a great spiritual attainment. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=213))
- Sometimes, however, talk of this kind is the really nasty kind of preaching affected by people who presume to be schoolmasters to their fellow man. But their sermons never have the slightest creative effect, since the only motives for action which they supply are shame or fear or guilt, and when we respond to such motives we find only a balm for the ego’s injured pride— ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=215))
- find life by losing it. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=219))
- the state metaphorically called death or self-surrender is not a future condition to be acquired. It is rather a present fact. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=219))
- emotions appear only as manifestations of a state of tension and resistance. If I did not dislike fear, it would not be fear. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=223))
- resentment of those emotions, our unwillingness to experience them, is totally ineffectual. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=224))
- And our attempts to stand above these emotions and control them are the emotions themselves at play, since love is also to be in love with love, and sadness to be sorry that one is sad. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=227))
- unwillingness to feel ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=228))
- events toward which our sole response is a response of feeling. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=246))
- the very special feelings which arise when we are faced with a conflict of feelings which cannot be resolved. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=247))
- fruitless attempt to talk oneself out of them. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=249))
- wisdom emerges when we give up resisting them— ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=253))
- sense of freedom from the bonds ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=256))
- But ordinarily we do not discover the wisdom of our feelings because we do not let them complete their work; we try to suppress them or discharge them in premature action, not realizing that they are a process of creation which, like birth, begins as a pain and turns into a child. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=257))
- that very illusion of self-mastery which stands in the way. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=261))
- when I discover that I cannot surrender myself that I am surrendered; just when I find that I cannot accept myself that I am accepted. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=262))
- all this striving for self-surrender is like trying to put legs on a snake— ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=264))
- THE HIGHEST WISDOM lies in detachment, ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=271))
- Detachment means to have neither regrets for the past nor fears for the future; to let life take its course without attempting to interfere with its movement and change, neither trying to prolong the stay of things pleasant nor to hasten the departure of things unpleasant. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=272))
- To do this is to move in time with life, to be in perfect accord with its changing music, and this is called Enlightenment. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=274))
- Life exists only at this very moment, and in this moment it is infinite and eternal. For the present moment is infinitely small; before we can measure it, it has gone, and yet it persists for ever. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=276))
- eternally resting. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=280))
- if we try to accord with it, we shall get away from it. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=280))
- though your thoughts may run into the past or the future they cannot escape the present moment. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=282))
- thoughts are themselves of the moment; ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=283))
- You may believe yourself out of harmony with life and its eternal Now; but you cannot be, for you are life and exist Now— ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=284))
- So become what you are. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=286))
- suggests that religion is a medicine rather than a diet. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=290))
- Lucretius: Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum (Too much religion is apt to encourage evil). ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=293))
- it is so easy to get stuck—on the raft, ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=299))
- Religion, ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=302))
- is altogether a pointing—and it does not point at itself. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=303))
- ‘‘Your everyday mind is the Tao.’’ ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=307))
- But this doesn’t help, either, for as soon as I try to understand what is meant by my everyday mind, and then try to latch on to it, I am just sucking another finger. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=308))
- tormenting nostalgia ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=318))
- To see the moon, you must forget the pointing finger, and simply look at the moon. ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=333))
- If you want to know what reality is, you must look directly at it and see for yourself. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=335))
- free from wandering words and from the floating fantasies ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=337))
- the only way to concentrate is to concentrate. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=342))
- if you want to make this kind of thing horribly difficult, you begin to think about timing yourself. Instead of concentrating, you begin to think about whether you are concentrating, about how long you have concentrated, and about how much longer you are going to keep it up. All this is totally off the point. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=349))
- Concentrate for one second. If, at the end of this time, your mind has wandered off, concentrate for another second, and then another. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=351))
- Nobody ever has to concentrate for more than one second—this one. This is why it is quite literally off the point to time yourself, to compete with yourself, and to bother about your progress and success in the art. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=352))
- It’s simply the old story of making a difficult job easy by taking it one step at a time. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=353))
- in the state of concentration, of clear unwavering attention, one has no self—that is, no self-consciousness. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=355))
- We want to enjoy ourselves, and fear that if we forget ourselves there will be no enjoyment—an entertainment without anyone present to be entertained. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=357))
- For if you try to watch your mind concentrate, it will not concentrate. And if, when it is concentrated, you begin to watch for the arrival of some insight into reality, you have stopped concentrating. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=362))
- so preoccupied with the idea of doing it that they never really do it at all. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=370))
- If you happen to be sitting, just sit. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=381))
- But don’t think and reflect unnecessarily, compulsively, from sheer force of nervous habit. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=381))
- In Zen, they call this having a leaky mind— ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=382))
- While modern astronomy tells us of our insignificance beneath the stars, it also tells us that if we lift so much as a finger, we affect them. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=396))
- your mind can function “self-so”—though most of us are much too afraid of ourselves to try the experiment. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=410))
- our principal problem in life is ourselves— ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=425))
- the problem is the pain of trying to avoid suffering and the fear of trying not to be afraid. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=427))
- according to Lao-tzu, the way back, or forward, to harmony with the Tao is, in the profoundest and most radical sense, to do nothing at all. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=430))
- this special kind of doing nothing is called wu-wei—literally, nondoing or nonstriving. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=433))
- the way of deliberate imitation. This is to suppose that we actually know what the sane and natural way of living is, to embody it in laws and principles, techniques and ideals, and then try by a deliberate effort of imitation to follow them. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=437))
- deliberate relaxation, the way of “to hell with it all.” ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=441))
- This leads to a vast, sloppy, disorganized mess, or to a kind of compulsive stillness, or sometimes to an equally compulsive psychological diarrhea. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=442))
- Both of these courses are far short of the real mui, of profound and radical nondoing. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=444))
- mui is not seeking for any result. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=451))
- I am talking of results in the moral and spiritual sphere—such things as goodness, peace of mind, sanity, happiness, personality, courage, and so forth. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=452))
- a result-seeking mechanism. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=458))
- This is a hopelessly and wildly fouled-up feedback mechanism. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=462))
- You see yourself as a purpose-seeking creature, but realize that there is no purpose for the existence of such a creature. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=467))
- Your aim is to preserve and perpetuate yourself, but in the larger context of the universe there is no reason, no purpose for this aim. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=468))
- we cannot make the Tao a goal any more than we can aim an arrow at itself. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=477))
- the antidote to ignorance is not action but knowledge—not what to do, but what we know. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=483))
- seriousness which drags man down to the earth and kills the life ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=497))
- playacting ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=498))
- seriousness becomes a vice in the adult, ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=500))
- instead of playing his part, his part plays him ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=503))
- he takes seriously what the gods made for fun. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=507))
- this detachment from is also a harmony with, ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=522))
- the word despair in a particular sense is the proper translation of the Hindu–Buddhist term nirvana—to “de-spirate,” to breathe out, to give up the ghost. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=530))
- Asians manage to equate this despair with ultimate bliss— ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=531))
- Without exception, everything that we attain or create, even the memorials that survive our death, must perish without trace, and that our quest for permanence is pure futility. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=551))
- happiness exists only in relation to misery, pleasure in relation to pain, ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=552))
- Shunyata, the Nothing beyond nothing, ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=563))
- Western culture is dedicated to the belief that there is a formula for happiness— ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=570))
- there is no Way. Nobody knows the Way. The only way that there is is the path of a bird through the sky—now you see it, now you don’t. ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=577))
- Life is not going anywhere; there is nothing to be attained. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=578))
- All striving and grasping is so much smoke in the clutch of a dissolving hand. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=579))
- everyone is dissolving into nothing, and no one can help it. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=582))
- Just watching. Not trying to get anything. Not expecting anything. Not hoping. Not seeking. Not trying to relax. Just watching, without purpose. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=588))
- To hold out hope, to promise a result, spoils the whole thing. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=589))
- They must happen by themselves. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=601))
- ALMOST EVERY FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF LIFE can be expressed in two opposite ways. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=605))
- There are those who say that to attain the highest wisdom we must be still and calm, immovable in the midst of turmoil. And there are those who say that we must move on as life moves, never stopping for a moment either in fear of what is to come or to turn a regretful glance at what has gone. ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=606))
- receives, but does not keep. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=610))
- This critique is based not so much upon a psychological analysis of the experience itself as upon purely logical analysis of such universal concepts as God, Ultimate Reality, Absolute Being, and the like— ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=631))
- “the universe was made by God” has seemed as much a statement of the historical type as that “the telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell.” ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=654))
- “truth” as a structure of objective reality, ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=657))
- a body of theory to explain the past and predict the future. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=660))
- the attempt to talk about, think about, or know about ultimate Reality constitutes an impossible task. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=683))
- the same way that fire can burn other things but cannot burn itself. ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=688))
- the unknowable need not and cannot concern us further. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=715))
- The more complete kind of mind, which can feel as well as think, remains to “indulge” the odd sense of mystery which comes from contemplating the fact that everything is at base something which cannot be known.

- The object of Hindu, and for that matter of almost all Asian religion, is to awaken in man the realization of this unity and identity. In Hinduism this realization is called moksha or kaivalya, and in Buddhism Nirvana, and it is astonishing how seldom the West achieves any real understanding of what this condition of the spirit involves.

- The unenlightened man keeps a tight hold on himself because he is afraid of losing himself; he can trust neither circumstances nor his own human nature; he is terrified of being genuine, of accepting himself as he is and tries to deceive himself into the belief that he is as he wishes to be. ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1225))
- But these are the wishes, the desires that bind him, and it was such desires as these that the Buddha described as the cause of human misery. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1227))
- People imagine that letting themselves go would have disastrous results; trusting neither circumstances nor themselves, which together make up life, they are forever interfering and trying to make their own souls and the world conform with preconceived patterns. ([Location 1228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1228))
- This interference is simply the attempt of the ego to dominate life. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1230))
- In fact you have always had this freedom, for the state of union with Brahman can neither be attained nor lost; ([Location 1232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1232))

- Philosophically this condition is known as infinite regression, and psychologically it is that mad, exasperating state that must always precede the final experience of awakening. ([Location 1252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1252))
- the famous triangle puzzle of Mahayana philosophy.

- Enlightenment (the Buddhist life-goal) consists of an inner realization of nonduality. All those things upon which unenlightened man depends for his happiness are dual, and thus conditioned by their opposites. Life cannot be had without death, pleasure without evil. We cannot, therefore, depend for our ultimate salvation and security upon any one aspect of a given pair of opposites (dvandva), for the two are as essential to each other as back and front are essential to the totality of any object.

- free within ourselves, ([Location 1622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1622))
- at home with ourselves and with the universe in which we live. ([Location 1623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1623))
- This freedom is known when we give up “contriving” and accept ourselves as we are, but it does not seem to me that the experience can be effective unless there has first been a state of contriving and struggle.

- We use God, if we may dare to say so, whenever we make an act of our will, and when we proceed to execute a purpose. He has not merely given us clearness of head, tenderness of heart, and strength of limb, as gifts which we may use independently of Him when once He has conferred them upon us. But He distinctly permits and actually concurs with every use of them in thinking, loving or acting. ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1683))

- if anyone watches it in order to see God he will surely be disappointed. ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1747))
- The idea of God is a finger pointing the way to Reality, but when people try to join God and Reality, to identify the one with the other, to find the former in the latter, they are trying to join together two things that were never in need of being joined. ([Location 1749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1749))

- it is asked whether Tao means Life in the sense of simple existence, or whether Tao is Life lived in a special way, lived faithfully, thoroughly, vitally and with a certain zest born of the joy of being alive. ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1783))
- “If you try to accord with it,” said the teacher, “you will get away from it.” ([Location 1788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LU5H19W&location=1788))
