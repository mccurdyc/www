## My Thoughts

While I think it was a good read --- especially for someone like myself who doesn't
have a great understanding of historical events --- it felt pretty surface-level
in most chapters. There were a few chapters where I did feel that Yuval went a
"layer" or two deeper on a topic and appreciated that. Again, while this is
definitely a great book for the masses, I was slightly surprised to hear
folks like [Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and more](https://www.kevinrooke.com/book-recommendations/naval-ravikant)
recommend this book so strongly. I assume the recommendations are based primarily
on the clarity of Yuval's writing and less so based on these folks learning something
new or hearing a novel perspective.

Sapiens had a similar feel at some points to [Enlightment Now by Steven Pinker](./enlightenment-now.md),
which isn't too surprising. Both --- Enlightment Now is definitely more
empirical --- mention how the world is improving in many regards, but then questions
whether it matters because one's happiness is still determined relatively.

Would I recommend this book? Probably. It was a good, fairly quick read,
but I think I'd more strongly recommend this conversation between
[Mark Zuckerberg and Yuval Noah Harari](https://youtu.be/Boj9eD0Wug8) where they
discuss really challenging systems problems of today and the future. I think this
is a perfect example of what I mean when I say "Sapiens isn't 'deep'". In this
conversation, topics on many occassions go two or three, maybe even four levels
deep. I watched this interview when I was about 3/4 of the way through Sapiens
and the interview made me "trust" Yuval and want to finish the book.

## Highlights
- Three important revolutions shaped the course of history: the Cognitive Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 years ago. The Agricultural Revolution sped it up about 12,000 years ago. The Scientific Revolution, which got under way only 500 years ago, may well end history and start something completely different. This book tells the story of how these three revolutions have affected humans and their fellow organisms. (Page 10)
- Animals much like modern humans first appeared about 2.5 million years ago. But for countless generations they did not stand out from the myriad other organisms that populated the planet. (Page 10)
- the species sapiens (wise) of the genus Homo (man). (Page 11)
- and there used to be many other species of this genus besides Homo sapiens. (Page 11)
- Homo erectus, ‘Upright Man’, who survived there for close to 2 million years, making it the most durable human species ever. This record is unlikely to be broken even by our own species. It is doubtful whether Homo sapiens will still be around a thousand years from now, so 2 million years is really out of our league. (Page 14)
- The truth is that from about 2 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago, the world was home, at one and the same time, to several human species. (Page 15)
- As we will shortly see, we Sapiens have good reasons to repress the memory of our siblings. (Page 15)
- Why are giant brains so rare in the animal kingdom? (Page 16)
- The fact is that a jumbo brain is a jumbo drain on the body. (Page 16)
- What then drove forward the evolution of the massive human brain during those 2 million years? Frankly, we don’t know. (Page 16)
- The first evidence for tool production dates from about 2.5 million years ago, (Page 16)
- humans are born prematurely, (Page 16)
- Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years (Page 16)
- This fact has contributed greatly both to humankind’s extraordinary social abilities and to its unique social problems. (Page 17)
- It takes a tribe to raise a human. (Page 17)
- Evolution thus favoured those capable of forming strong social ties. (Page 17)
- Humans emerge from the womb like molten glass from a furnace. (Page 17)
- the first humans specialised in extracting marrow from bones. (Page 17)
- For millions of years, humans hunted smaller creatures and gathered what they could, (Page 17)
- only in the last 100,000 years–with the rise of Homo sapiens–that man jumped to the top of the food chain. (Page 17)
- consequences. Other animals at the top of the pyramid, such as lions and sharks, evolved into that position very gradually, over millions of years. This enabled the ecosystem to develop checks and balances that prevent lions and sharks from wreaking too much havoc. (Page 17)
- A significant step on the way to the top was the domestication of fire. (Page 18)
- the best thing fire did was cook. (Page 18)
- chimpanzees spend five hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. (Page 18)
- most scientists agree that by 150,000 years ago, East Africa was populated by Sapiens that looked just like us. (Page 19)
- 70,000 years ago, Sapiens from East Africa spread into the Arabian peninsula, and from there they quickly overran the entire Eurasian landmass. (Page 19)
- most of Eurasia was already settled by other humans. (Page 19)
- The ‘Interbreeding Theory’ tells a story of attraction, (Page 19)
- The opposing view, called the ‘Replacement Theory’ tells a very different story–one of incompatibility, revulsion, and perhaps even genocide. (Page 19)
- If the Replacement Theory is correct, all living humans have roughly the same genetic baggage, and racial distinctions among them are negligible. (Page 20)
- But if the Interbreeding Theory is right, there might well be genetic differences between Africans, Europeans and Asians that go back hundreds of thousands of years. (Page 20)
- It turned out that 1–4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern populations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. (Page 21)
- Over the past 10,000 years, Homo sapiens has grown so accustomed to being the only human species that it’s hard for us to conceive of any other possibility. (Page 23)
- When Charles Darwin indicated that Homo sapiens was just another kind of animal, people were outraged. Even today many refuse to believe it. (Page 23)
- What was the Sapiens’ secret of success? (Page 23)
- language. (Page 23)
- They looked like us, but their cognitive abilities–learning, remembering, communicating–were far more limited. (Page 24)
- 45,000 years ago, they somehow crossed the open sea and landed in Australia (Page 24)
- 30,000 years ago witnessed the invention of boats, oil lamps, bows and arrows and needles (Page 24)
- The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. (Page 25)
- pure chance, as far as we can tell. (Page 25)
- What, then, is so special about our language? (Page 25)
- communicate a prodigious amount of information (Page 25)
- Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. (Page 25)
- The new linguistic skills that modern Sapiens acquired about seventy millennia ago enabled them to gossip for hours on end. (Page 27)
- Reliable information about who could be trusted meant that small bands could expand into larger bands, (Page 27)
- Even today the vast majority of human communication–whether in the form of emails, phone calls or newspaper columns–is gossip. (Page 27)
- Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. (Page 27)
- As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled. (Page 27)
- This ability to speak about fictions is the most unique feature of Sapiens language. (Page 27)
- fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively. (Page 27)
- Sapiens can cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers. (Page 27)
- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition. (Page 28)
- There are clear limits to the size of groups that can be formed and maintained in such a way. In order to function, all members of a group must know each other intimately. (Page 28)
- Under natural conditions, a typical chimpanzee troop consists of about twenty to fifty individuals. (Page 28)
- In the wake of the Cognitive Revolution, gossip helped Homo sapiens to form larger and more stable bands. (Page 29)
- The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. (Page 29)
- Any large-scale human cooperation–whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe–is rooted in common myths that exist only in people’s collective imagination. (Page 29)
- Yet none of these things exists outside the stories that people invent and tell one another. There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings. (Page 29)
- legal fictions called ‘limited liability companies’. The idea behind such companies is among humanity’s most ingenious inventions. (Page 31)
- companies. Such companies were legally independent of the people who set them up, or invested money in them, or managed them. (Page 31)
- Telling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. (Page 32)
- Green monkeys and chimpanzees can lie. (Page 32)
- Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, (Page 33)
- large-scale human cooperation is based on myths, (Page 33)
- In 1789 the French population switched almost overnight from believing in the myth of the divine right of kings to believing in the myth of the sovereignty of the people. (Page 33)
- ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have been able to change their behaviour quickly, transmitting new behaviours to future generations without any need of genetic or environmental change. (Page 34)
- while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two. (Page 34)
- Yet the fact is that no animal other than Sapiens engages in trade, (Page 36)
- Trade cannot exist without trust, and it is very difficult to trust strangers. (Page 36)
- The immense diversity of imagined realities that Sapiens invented, and the resulting diversity of behaviour patterns, are the main components of what we call ‘cultures’. (Page 37)
- For nearly the entire history of our species, Sapiens lived as foragers. (Page 39)
- The flourishing field of evolutionary psychology argues that many of our present-day social and psychological characteristics were shaped during this long pre-agricultural era. (Page 39)
- Even today, scholars in this field claim, our brains and minds are adapted to a life of hunting and gathering. (Page 39)
- Why, for example, do people gorge on high-calorie food that is doing little good to their bodies? Today’s affluent societies are in the throes of a plague of obesity, (Page 39)
- The debate between the ‘ancient commune’ and ‘eternal monogamy’ schools is based on flimsy evidence. (Page 40)
- Foragers moved house every month, every week, and sometimes even every day, toting whatever they had on their backs. (Page 41)
- They consequently had to make do with only the most essential possessions. (Page 41)
- were able to create very different imagined realities, which manifested themselves in different norms and values. (Page 42)
- the vast majority of people lived in small bands numbering several dozen or at most several hundred individuals, (Page 42)
- needs. A 15,000-year bond has yielded a much deeper understanding and affection between humans and dogs (Page 43)
- she encountered throughout her life no more than a few thousand humans. (Page 43)
- Fishing villages might have appeared on the coasts of Indonesian islands as early as 45,000 years ago. (Page 45)
- first transoceanic enterprise: the invasion of Australia. (Page 45)
- gathering was Sapiens’ main activity, (Page 45)
- the average forager had wider, deeper and more varied knowledge of her immediate surroundings than most of her modern descendants. (Page 45)
- The human collective knows far more today than did the ancient bands. But at the individual level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable and skilful people in history. (Page 45)
- In most places and at most times, foraging provided ideal nutrition. That is hardly surprising–this had been the human diet for hundreds of thousands of years, and the human body was well adapted to (Page 46)
- Average life expectancy was apparently just thirty to forty years, but this was due largely to the high incidence of child mortality. (Page 46)
- The foragers’ secret of success, which protected them from starvation and malnutrition, was their varied diet. (Page 46)
- Ancient foragers also suffered less from infectious diseases. (Page 47)
- The wholesome and varied diet, the relatively short working week, and the rarity of infectious diseases have led many experts to define pre-agricultural forager societies as ‘the original affluent societies’. (Page 47)
- the Sungir children are among the best pieces of evidence that 30,000 years ago Sapiens could invent sociopolitical codes (Page 52)
- Some scholars imagine ancient hunter-gatherer societies as peaceful paradises, (Page 52)
- war and violence began only with the Agricultural Revolution, when people started to accumulate private property. (Page 52)
- during pre-industrial warfare more than 90 percent of war dead were killed by starvation, cold and disease rather than by weapons. (Page 53)
- nothing would have survived from such an encounter except, at best, a few fossilised bones and a handful of stone tools that remain mute under the most intense scholarly inquisitions. We may extract from them information about human anatomy, human technology, human diet, and perhaps even human social structure. (Page 54)
- But they reveal nothing about the political alliance forged between neighbouring Sapiens bands, about the spirits of the dead that blessed this alliance, or about the ivory beads secretly given to the local witch doctor in order to secure the blessing of the spirits. (Page 54)
- Yet they were unable to venture into the open sea, and none reached America, Australia, or remote islands such as Madagascar, New Zealand and Hawaii. (Page 55)
- The sea barrier prevented not just humans but also many other Afro-Asian animals and plants from reaching this ‘Outer World’. As a result, the organisms of distant lands like Australia and Madagascar evolved in isolation for millions upon millions of years, (Page 55)
- rising sea levels have buried the ancient Indonesian shoreline under 300 feet of ocean). (Page 56)
- The journey of the first humans to Australia is one of the most important events in history, at least as important as Columbus’ journey to America or the Apollo II expedition to the moon. It was the first time any human had managed to leave the Afro-Asian ecological system (Page 56)
- Up until then humans had displayed some innovative adaptations and behaviours, but their effect on their environment had been negligible. They had demonstrated remarkable success in moving into and adjusting to various habitats, but they did so without drastically changing those habitats. (Page 56)
- our planet has experienced numerous cycles of cooling and warming. (Page 57)
- During the last million years, there has been an ice age on average every 100,000 years. (Page 57)
- The last one ran from about 75,000 to 15,000 years ago. (Page 57)
- Thirdly, mass extinctions akin to the archetypal Australian decimation occurred again and again in the ensuing millennia–whenever people settled another part of the Outer World. (Page 57)
- Stone Age technology. How could they cause an ecological disaster? (Page 58)
- the Australian extinction–breed slowly. Pregnancy is long, offspring per pregnancy are few, and there are long breaks between pregnancies. (Page 58)
- Around 14,000 BC, the chase took some of them from north-eastern Siberia to Alaska. (Page 60)
- By 10,000 BC, humans already inhabited the most southern point in America, (Page 60)
- No other animal had ever moved into such a huge variety of radically different habitats so quickly, everywhere using virtually the same genes. (Page 60)
- Within 2,000 years of the Sapiens arrival, most of these unique species were gone. (Page 60)
- Homo sapiens drove to extinction about half of the planet’s big beasts long before humans invented the wheel, writing, or iron tools. (Page 61)
- The tragedy opens with a scene showing a rich and varied population of large animals, without any trace of humans. In scene two, Sapiens appear, evidenced by a human bone, a spear point, or perhaps a potsherd. Scene three quickly follows, in which men and women occupy centre stage and most large animals, along with many smaller ones, are gone. (Page 61)
- The First Wave Extinction, which accompanied the spread of the foragers, was followed by the Second Wave Extinction, which accompanied the spread of the farmers, and gives us an important perspective on the Third Wave Extinction, which industrial activity is causing today. (Page 63)
- the large sea animals suffered relatively little from the Cognitive and Agricultural Revolutions. (Page 63)
- Wheat and goats were domesticated by approximately 9000 BC; peas and lentils around 8000 BC; olive trees by 5000 BC; horses by 4000 BC; and grapevines in 3500 BC. (Page 65)
- By the first century AD the vast majority of people throughout most of the world were agriculturists. (Page 66)
- Of the thousands of species that our ancestors hunted and gathered, only a few were suitable candidates for farming and herding. (Page 66)
- In areas such as the Great Plains of North America, where not a single wheat stalk grew 10,000 years ago, you can today walk for hundreds upon hundreds of miles without encountering any other plant. Worldwide, wheat covers about 870,000 square miles of the globe’s surface, (Page 67)
- humans in many parts of the world were doing little from dawn to dusk other than taking care of wheat plants. (Page 67)
- We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. (Page 68)
- Farming societies have, until very recently, relied for the great bulk of their calorie intake on a small variety of domesticated plants. (Page 68)
- in simple agricultural societies with no political frameworks beyond village and tribe, human violence was responsible for about 15 per cent of deaths, including 25 per cent of male deaths. (Page 69)
- our affluence and security are built on foundations laid by the Agricultural Revolution, (Page 69)
- it is wrong to judge thousands of years of history from the perspective of today. (Page 69)
- Would she say ‘I am dying from malnutrition, but in 2,000 years, people will have plenty to eat and live in big air-conditioned houses, so my suffering is a worthwhile sacrifice’? (Page 70)
- The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. (Page 70)
- The foragers became farmers. (Page 71)
- With the move to permanent villages and the increase in food supply, the population began to grow. (Page 72)
- Giving up the nomadic lifestyle enabled women to have a child every year. (Page 72)
- disease-ridden settlements, (Page 72)
- child mortality soared. (Page 72)
- at least one out of every three children died before reaching twenty. (Page 72)
- The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done. Paradoxically, a series of ‘improvements’, each of which was meant to make life easier, added up to a millstone around the necks of these farmers. (Page 72)
- people throughout history have miscalculated. (Page 72)
- why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. (Page 72)
- There was no going back. The trap snapped shut. (Page 72)
- The pursuit of an easier life resulted in much hardship, (Page 72)
- It happens to us today. How many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away. (Page 72)
- luxuries tend to become necessities (Page 73)
- Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. (Page 73)
- but do I live a more relaxed life? (Page 73)
- We thought we were saving time; instead we revved up the treadmill of life to ten times its former speed and made our days more anxious and agitated. (Page 73)
- the luxury trap. (Page 73)
- It is difficult to prove that preliterate people were motivated by faith rather than economic necessity. (Page 74)
- Why would a foraging society build such structures? (Page 76)
- Only a sophisticated religious or ideological system could sustain such efforts. (Page 76)
- for the vast majority of domesticated animals, the Agricultural Revolution was a terrible catastrophe. (Page 80)
- THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION IS ONE of the most controversial events in history. (Page 82)
- This minuscule 2 per cent of the earth’s surface constituted the stage on which history unfolded. (Page 83)
- They could not abandon their houses, fields and granaries without grave risk of loss. Furthermore, as time went on they accumulated more and more things–objects, not easily transportable, that tied them down. Ancient farmers might seem to us dirt poor, but a typical family possessed more artefacts than an entire forager tribe. (Page 83)
- Farmers sailed in their imagination years and decades into the future. (Page 83)
- Foragers discounted the future because they lived from hand to mouth (Page 83)
- from the very advent of agriculture, worries about the future became major players in the theatre of the human mind. (Page 84)
- Until the late modern era, more than 90 percent of humans were peasants who rose each morning to till the land by the sweat of their brows. (Page 84)
- History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets. (Page 84)
- It was not food shortages that caused most of history’s wars and revolutions. The French Revolution was spearheaded by affluent lawyers, not by famished peasants. (Page 84)
- The handful of millennia separating the Agricultural Revolution from the appearance of cities, kingdoms and empires was not enough time to allow an instinct for mass cooperation to evolve. (Page 85)
- ‘mass cooperation networks’ (Page 86)
- Most human cooperation networks have been geared towards oppression and exploitation. (Page 86)
- The social norms that sustained them were based neither on ingrained instincts nor on personal acquaintances, but rather on belief in shared myths. (Page 87)
- The life of a female commoner is worth thirty silver shekels and that of a slave-woman twenty silver shekels, whereas the eye of a male commoner is worth sixty silver shekels. (Page 89)
- they are both wrong. Hammurabi and the American Founding Fathers alike imagined a reality governed by universal and immutable principles of justice, (Page 90)
- the only place where such universal principles exist is in the fertile imagination of Sapiens, (Page 90)
- The Americans got the idea of equality from Christianity, (Page 90)
- ‘equal’? Evolution is based on difference, not on equality. (Page 90)
- there are no such things as rights in biology. There are only organs, abilities and characteristics. Birds fly not because they have a right to fly, but because they have wings. (Page 90)
- We believe in a particular order not because it is objectively true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate effectively and forge a better society. (Page 91)
- Imagined orders are not evil conspiracies or useless mirages. (Page 91)
- we do not want to hear that human rights are also a myth. If people realise that human rights exist only in the imagination, isn’t there a danger that our society will collapse? (Page 91)
- an imagined order is always in danger of collapse, because it depends upon myths, and myths vanish once people stop believing in them. (Page 91)
- In order to safeguard an imagined order, continuous and strenuous efforts are imperative. (Page 91)
- A single priest often does the work of a hundred soldiers–far more cheaply and effectively. (Page 92)
- believe? (Page 92)
- Of all human collective activities, the one most difficult to organise is violence. (Page 92)
- Most Westerners today believe in individualism. (Page 93)
- Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human potential we must have as many different experiences as we can. (Page 94)
- Romanticism, which encourages variety, meshes perfectly with consumerism. (Page 94)
- The imagined order is inter-subjective. (Page 95)
- Even if by some superhuman effort I succeed in freeing my personal desires from the grip of the imagined order, I am just one person. (Page 95)
- Many of history’s most important drivers are inter-subjective: law, money, gods, nations. (Page 96)
- Peugeot, for example, is not the imaginary friend of Peugeot’s CEO. The company exists in the shared imagination of millions of people. The CEO believes in the company’s existence because the board of directors also believes in it, as do the company’s lawyers, the secretaries in the nearby office, the tellers in the bank, the brokers on the stock exchange, and car dealers from France to Australia. If the CEO alone were suddenly to stop believing in Peugeot’s existence, he’d quickly land in the nearest mental hospital and someone else would occupy his office. (Page 96)
- These imagined orders are inter-subjective, so in order to change them we must simultaneously change the consciousness of billions of people, which is not easy. (Page 96)
- A change of such magnitude can be accomplished only with the help of a complex organisation, such as a political party, an ideological movement, or a religious cult. (Page 96)
- It follows that in order to change an existing imagined order, we must first believe in an alternative imagined order. (Page 97)
- There is no way out of the imagined order. (Page 97)
- When we break down our prison walls and run towards freedom, we are in fact running into the more spacious exercise yard of a bigger prison. (Page 97)
- They can nevertheless play the game with complete strangers because they have all learned an identical set of ideas about basketball. These ideas are entirely imaginary, but if everyone shares them, we can all play the game. (Page 98)
- Bees don’t need lawyers, because there is no danger that they might forget or violate the hive constitution. The queen does not cheat the cleaner bees of their food, and they never go on strike demanding higher wages. (Page 98)
- But when particularly complex societies began to appear in the wake of the Agricultural Revolution, a completely new type of information became vital–numbers. (Page 99)
- This mental limitation severely constrained the size and complexity of human collectives. (Page 100)
- For thousands of years after the Agricultural Revolution, human social networks remained relatively small and simple. (Page 100)
- Between the years 3500 BC and 3000 BC, some unknown Sumerian geniuses invented a system for storing and processing information outside their brains, (Page 100)
- The data-processing system invented by the Sumerians is called ‘writing’. (Page 100)
- the first texts of history contain no philosophical insights, no poetry, legends, laws, or even royal triumphs. They are humdrum economic documents, recording the payment of taxes, the accumulation of debts and the ownership of property. (Page 101)
- It didn’t disturb the Sumerians that their script was ill-suited for writing poetry. (Page 103)
- Each quipu consisted of many cords of different colours, made of wool or cotton. (Page 103)
- Thanks to quipus, the Incas could save and process large amounts of data, without which they would not have been able to maintain the complex administrative machinery that an empire of that size requires. (Page 104)
- The Hebrew Bible, the Greek Iliad, the Hindu Mahabharata and the Buddhist Tipitika all began as oral works. (Page 104)
- Clearly, just imprinting a document in clay is not enough to guarantee efficient, accurate and convenient data processing. (Page 105)
- That requires methods of organisation like catalogues, methods of reproduction like photocopy machines, methods of rapid and accurate retrieval like computer algorithms, and pedantic (but hopefully cheerful) librarians who know how to use these tools. Inventing such methods proved to be far more difficult than inventing writing. (Page 105)
- The most important impact of script on human history is precisely this: it has gradually changed the way humans think and view the world. Free association and holistic thought have given way to compartmentalisation and bureaucracy. (Page 106)
- They divided people into make-believe groups, (Page 109)
- The American order thereby upheld the hierarchy of wealth, (Page 109)
- scholars know of no large society that has been able to dispense with discrimination altogether. (Page 111)
- Time and again people have created order in their societies by classifying the population into imagined categories, such as superiors, commoners and slaves; whites and blacks; patricians and plebeians; Brahmins and Shudras; or rich and poor. (Page 111)
- Hierarchies serve an important function. They enable complete strangers to know how to treat one another without wasting the time and energy needed to become personally acquainted. (Page 111)
- social cues (Page 112)
- they will have to play the game by different rules. (Page 112)
- societies are based on imagined hierarchies, (Page 112)
- Throughout history, and in almost all societies, concepts of pollution and purity have played a leading role in enforcing social and political divisions and have been exploited by numerous ruling classes to maintain their privileges. (Page 113)
- If you want to keep any human group isolated–women, Jews, Roma, gays, blacks–the best way to do it is convince everyone that these people are a source of pollution. (Page 113)
- Groups that failed to win recognition as a caste were, literally, outcasts (Page 113)
- In modern India, matters of marriage and work are still heavily influenced by the caste system, (Page 113)
- even though the slaves were freed, the racist myths that justified slavery persisted. Separation of the races was maintained by racist legislation and social custom. (Page 114)
- Unjust discrimination often gets worse, not better, with time. (Page 116)
- Those once victimised by history are likely to be victimised yet again. And those whom history has privileged are more likely to be privileged again. (Page 116)
- nothing but the perpetuation of chance events supported by myths. (Page 116)
- Different societies adopt different kinds of imagined hierarchies. (Page 117)
- Does having a womb make a person unfit, biologically, for these professions? (Page 118)
- How can we distinguish what is biologically determined from what people merely try to justify through biological myths? (Page 118)
- ‘Biology enables, Culture forbids.’ (Page 118)
- Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. (Page 118)
- our concepts ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’ are taken not from biology, but from Christian theology. (Page 119)
- Since myths, rather than biology, define the roles, rights and duties of men and women, the meaning of ‘manhood’ and ‘womanhood’ have varied immensely from one society to another. (Page 120)
- At least since the Agricultural Revolution, most human societies have been patriarchal societies that valued men more highly than women. (Page 123)
- Patriarchy has been the norm in almost all agricultural and industrial societies. (Page 124)
- there is some universal biological reason why almost all cultures valued manhood over womanhood. We do not know what this reason is. There are plenty of theories, none of them convincing. (Page 124)
- The most common theory points to the fact that men are stronger than women, (Page 124)
- political dominance generally resides with the person possessing the best social skills rather than the most developed musculature. (Page 125)
- why couldn’t an all-male soldiery be controlled by an all-female or at least partly female government? In fact, in numerous societies throughout history, the top officers did not work their way up from the rank of private. Aristocrats, the wealthy and the educated were automatically assigned officer rank and never served as common soldiers. (Page 125)
- modern historians often attribute this feat to his virtue of clementia–mildness and clemency. (Page 126)
- Bonobo and elephant societies are controlled by strong networks of cooperative females, (Page 127)
- At present, we have no good answer. (Page 128)
- during the last century gender roles have undergone a tremendous revolution. (Page 128)
- They thereby created artificial instincts that enabled millions of strangers to cooperate effectively. This network of artificial instincts is called ‘culture’. (Page 130)
- Only a force applied from outside could change them. (Page 130)
- Cultures are constantly trying to reconcile these contradictions, and this process fuels change. (Page 130)
- For instance, in medieval Europe the nobility believed in both Christianity and chivalry. (Page 130)
- Ever since the French Revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both social equality and individual freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other. (Page 131)
- The entire political history of the world since 1789 can be seen as a series of attempts to reconcile this contradiction. (Page 131)
- Just as medieval culture did not manage to square chivalry with Christianity, so the modern world fails to square liberty with equality. (Page 131)
- cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is often considered a failure of the human psyche. In fact, it is a vital asset. (Page 131)
- simple cultures gradually coalesce into bigger and more complex civilisations, so that the world contains fewer and fewer mega-cultures, (Page 132)
- it’s hard to say whether history moves in the direction of unity or of diversity. (Page 132)
- history is moving relentlessly towards unity. (Page 132)
- Today, we are used to thinking about the whole planet as a single unit, but for most of history, earth was in fact an entire galaxy of isolated human worlds. (Page 132)
- the Afro-Asian giant swallowed up all the other worlds. (Page 133)
- Today when Iran and the United States rattle swords at one another, they both speak the language of nation states, capitalist economies, international rights and nuclear physics. (Page 134)
- global unification occurred in the last few centuries, (Page 135)
- during the first millennium BC, when the idea of a universal order took root. (Page 135)
- The first universal order to appear was economic: the monetary order. The second universal order was political: the imperial order. The third universal order was religious: the order of universal religions such as Buddhism, Christianity and Islam. (Page 137)
- How did money succeed where gods and kings failed? (Page 137)
- obsession for gold (Page 138)
- useless yellow metal. (Page 138)
- As the Christians gradually gained the upper hand, they marked their victories not only by destroying mosques and building churches, but also by issuing new gold and silver coins bearing the sign of the cross and thanking God for His help in combating the infidels. (Page 138)
- Most people continued to live in small, intimate communities. Much like a hunter-gatherer band, each village was a self-sufficient economic unit, maintained by mutual favours and obligations plus a little barter with outsiders. (Page 139)
- An economy of favours and obligations doesn’t work when large numbers of strangers try to cooperate. It’s one thing to provide free assistance to a sister or a neighbour, a very different thing to take care of foreigners who might never reciprocate the favour. (Page 139)
- One can fall back on barter. But barter is effective only when exchanging a limited range of products. It cannot form the basis for a complex economy. (Page 139)
- In a barter economy, every day the shoemaker and the apple grower will have to learn anew the relative prices of dozens of commodities. (Page 140)
- a central barter system that collected products (Page 140)
- ‘Everyone would work according to their abilities, and receive according to their needs’ turned out in practice into ‘everyone would work as little as they can get away with, and receive as much as they could grab’. (Page 140)
- More than 90 percent of all money–more than $ 50 trillion appearing in our accounts–exists only on computer servers. (Page 142)
- As long as people are willing to trade goods and services in exchange for electronic data, (Page 142)
- dollars have value only in our common imagination. (Page 143)
- money isn’t a material reality–it is a psychological construct. (Page 143)
- Trust is the raw material from which all types of money are minted. (Page 143)
- Money is accordingly a system of mutual trust, and not just any system of mutual trust: money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised. (Page 143)
- Still, it was somewhat easier to build trust in barley as the first type of money, because barley has an inherent biological value. (Page 144)
- Almost all coins in use today are descendants of the Lydian coins. (Page 145)
- As long as people trusted the power and integrity of the king, they trusted his coins. (Page 145)
- It would have been impossible to collect barley taxes in Syria, transport the funds to the central treasury in Rome, and transport them again to Britain in order to pay the legions there. (Page 146)
- Yet why should Chinese, Indians, Muslims and Spaniards–who belonged to very different cultures that failed to agree about much of anything–nevertheless share the belief in gold? (Page 147)
- the fact that another person believes in cowry shells, or dollars, or electronic data, is enough to strengthen our own belief in them, (Page 147)
- religion asks us to believe in something, money asks us to believe that other people believe in something. (Page 147)
- Money is based on two universal principles: (Page 147)
- Universal convertibility: (Page 147)
- Universal trust: (Page 147)
- it corrodes local traditions, intimate relations and human values, replacing them with the cold laws of supply and demand. (Page 148)
- Human communities and families have always been based on belief in ‘priceless’ things, such as honour, loyalty, morality and love. These things lie outside the domain of the market, and they shouldn’t be bought or sold for money. (Page 148)
- Empires were one of the main reasons for the drastic reduction in human diversity. (Page 151)
- The imperial steamroller gradually obliterated the unique characteristics of numerous peoples (such as the Numantians), forging out of them new and much larger groups. (Page 151)
- In our time, ‘imperialist’ ranks second only to ‘fascist’ in the lexicon of political swear words. (Page 151)
- Building and maintaining an empire usually required the vicious slaughter of large populations and the brutal oppression of every-one who was left. (Page 152)
- Imperial elites used the profits of conquest to finance not only armies and forts but also philosophy, art, justice and charity. (Page 152)
- ‘We are conquering you for your own benefit,’ said the Persians. Cyrus wanted the peoples he subjected to love him and to count themselves lucky to be Persian vassals. (Page 154)
- Evolution has made Homo sapiens, like other social mammals, a xenophobic creature. (Page 154)
- According to traditional Chinese political theory, Heaven (Tian) is the source of all legitimate authority on earth. Heaven chooses the most worthy person or family and gives them the Mandate of Heaven. This person or family then rules over All Under Heaven (Tianxia) for the benefit of all its inhabitants. (Page 155)
- It is difficult to rule an empire in which every little district has its own set of laws, its own form of writing, its own language and its own money. Standardisation was a boon to emperors. (Page 156)
- The Mandate of Heaven was bestowed upon the emperor not in order to exploit the world, but in order to educate humanity. (Page 156)
- The Romans, too, justified their dominion by arguing that they were endowing the barbarians with peace, justice and refinement. (Page 156)
- Americans nowadays maintain that their government has a moral imperative to bring Third World countries the benefits of democracy and human rights, even if these goods are delivered by cruise missiles and F-16s. (Page 156)
- imperial civilisation may well have absorbed numerous contributions from various conquered peoples, (Page 157)
- Rulers and ruled alike came to see ‘them’ as ‘us’. (Page 157)
- All human cultures are at least in part the legacy of empires and imperial civilisations, (Page 161)
- Nobody really knows how to solve this thorny question of cultural inheritance. (Page 163)
- simplistically dividing the past into good guys and bad guys leads nowhere. (Page 164)
- An economic crisis in China or a new technology coming out of the USA can instantaneously disrupt economies on the other side of the planet. (Page 164)
- It is unlikely that humankind can deal with these challenges without global cooperation. (Page 164)
- Today religion is often considered a source of discrimination, disagreement and disunion. Yet, in fact, religion has been the third great unifier of humankind, alongside money and empires. (Page 165)
- structures. Religions assert that our laws are not the result of human caprice, but are ordained by an absolute and indisputable authority. (Page 165)
- This helps place at least some fundamental laws beyond challenge, thereby ensuring social stability. (Page 165)
- ancient religions were local and exclusive. (Page 166)
- As far as we know, universal and missionary religions began to appear only in the first millennium BC. (Page 166)
- Polytheism does not necessarily dispute the existence of a single power or law governing the entire universe. In fact, most polytheist and even animist religions recognised such a supreme power that stands behind all the different gods, demons and holy rocks. (Page 168)
- The fundamental insight of polytheism, which distinguishes it from monotheism, is that the supreme power governing the world is devoid of interests and biases, and therefore it is unconcerned with the mundane desires, cares and worries of humans. (Page 168)
- Polytheism is inherently open-minded, (Page 169)
- when polytheists conquered huge empires, they did not try to convert their subjects. (Page 169)
- In many cases the imperial elite itself adopted the gods and rituals of subject people. (Page 169)
- The only god that the Romans long refused to tolerate was the monotheistic and evangelising god of the Christians. (Page 169)
- The religious wars between Catholics and Protestants that swept Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are particularly notorious. (Page 169)
- All those involved accepted Christ’s divinity and His gospel of compassion and love. However, they disagreed about the nature of this love. Protestants believed that the divine love is so great that God was incarnated in flesh and allowed Himself to be tortured and crucified, thereby redeeming the original sin and opening the gates of heaven to all those who professed faith in Him. Catholics maintained that faith, while essential, was not enough. To enter heaven, believers had to participate in church rituals and do good deeds. (Page 169)
- These theological disputes turned so violent that during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Catholics and Protestants killed each other by the hundreds of thousands. (Page 170)
- The first monotheist religion known to us appeared in Egypt, c. 1350 BC, when Pharaoh Akhenaten declared that one of the minor deities of the Egyptian pantheon, the god Aten, was, in fact, the supreme power ruling the universe. (Page 170)
- Judaism, for example, argued that the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, yet His chief interest is in the tiny Jewish nation and in the obscure land of Israel. (Page 170)
- The big breakthrough came with Christianity. This faith began as an esoteric Jewish sect (Page 170)
- Monotheists have tended to be far more fanatical and missionary than polytheists. (Page 171)
- The Christian saints did not merely resemble the old polytheistic gods. (Page 173)
- Monotheists have to practise intellectual gymnastics to explain how an all-knowing, all-powerful and perfectly good God allows so much suffering in the world. One well-known explanation is that this is God’s way of allowing for human free will. Were there no evil, humans could not choose between good and evil, and hence there would be no free will. (Page 173)
- For dualists, it’s easy to explain evil. Bad things happen even to good people because the world is not governed single-handedly by a good God. There is an independent evil power loose in the world. (Page 173)
- monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. (Page 173)
- overrun by the monotheistic Muslims, (Page 174)
- the Devil or Satan–who can act independently, fight against the good God, and wreak havoc without God’s permission. How can a monotheist adhere to such a dualistic belief (which, by the way, is nowhere to be found in the Old Testament)? (Page 174)
- The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts. (Page 175)
- the superhuman order governing the world is the product of natural laws rather than of divine wills and whims. (Page 175)
- The central figure of Buddhism is not a god but a human being, Siddhartha Gautama. (Page 175)
- Yet no matter what they achieve, they are never content. (Page 175)
- Life is a pointless rat race. (Page 175)
- investigate suffering (Page 176)
- suffering is caused by the behaviour patterns of one’s own mind. (Page 176)
- the mind is always dissatisfied and restless. (Page 176)
- simply understands things as they are, (Page 177)
- If you experience sadness without craving that the sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness but you do not suffer from it. (Page 177)
- There can actually be richness in the sadness. (Page 177)
- If you experience joy without craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without losing your peace of mind. (Page 177)
- But how do you get the mind to accept things as they are, without craving? To accept sadness as sadness, joy as joy, pain as pain? (Page 177)
- ‘What am I experiencing now?’ rather than on ‘What would I rather be experiencing?’ (Page 177)
- ‘suffering arises from craving’ (Page 177)
- The first principle of monotheist religions is ‘God exists. What does He want from me?’ The first principle of Buddhism is ‘Suffering exists. How do I escape it?’ (Page 177)
- Buddhism does not deny the existence of gods–they are described as powerful beings who can bring rains and victories–but they have no influence on the law that suffering arises from craving. (Page 178)
- 99 per cent of Buddhists did not attain nirvana, and even if they hoped to do so in some future lifetime, they devoted most of their present lives to the pursuit of mundane achievements. So they continued to worship various gods, (Page 178)
- The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. (Page 178)
- Humanism has split into three rival sects that fight over the exact definition of ‘humanity’, just as rival Christian sects fought over the exact definition of God. Today, the most important humanist sect is liberal humanism, (Page 180)
- Socialists believe that ‘humanity’ is collective rather than individualistic. (Page 181)
- Whereas liberal humanism seeks as much freedom as possible for individual humans, (Page 181)
- The only humanist sect that has actually broken loose from traditional monotheism is evolutionary humanism, whose most famous representatives were the Nazis. (Page 181)
- Not that this process of expansion and unification was linear or without interruptions. (Page 186)
- A single travelled road leads from the past to the present, but myriad paths fork off into the future. (Page 186)
- At the beginning of the fourth century AD, the Roman Empire faced a wide horizon of religious possibilities. It could have stuck to its traditional and variegated polytheism. But its emperor, Constantine, looking back on a fractious century of civil war, seems to have thought that a single religion with a clear doctrine could help unify his ethnically diverse realm. He could have chosen any of a number of contemporary cults to be his national faith–Manichaeism, Mithraism, the cults of Isis or Cybele, Zoroastrianism, Judaism and even Buddhism were all available options. Why did he opt for Jesus? (Page 186)
- They attempt to reduce human history to the workings of biological, ecological or economic forces. (Page 187)
- They argue that there was something about the geography, genetics or economy of the Roman Mediterranean that made the rise of a monotheist religion inevitable. Yet most historians tend to be sceptical of such deterministic theories. (Page 187)
- When Constantine assumed the throne in 306, Christianity was little more than an esoteric Eastern sect. If you were to suggest then that it was about to become the Roman state religion, you’d have been laughed out of the room (Page 187)
- To acknowledge that history is not deterministic is to acknowledge that it is just a coincidence that most people today believe in nationalism, capitalism and human rights. (Page 188)
- History cannot be explained deterministically and it cannot be predicted because it is chaotic. (Page 188)
- history is what is called a ‘level two’ chaotic system. (Page 188)
- Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. (Page 188)
- Politics, too, is a second-order chaotic system. (Page 188)
- the reason the revolution didn’t happen is because we predicted it,’ (Page 188)
- We cannot explain the choices that history makes, (Page 189)
- Ever more scholars see cultures as a kind of mental infection or parasite, with humans as its unwitting host. (Page 189)
- Successful cultures are those that excel in reproducing their memes, irrespective of the costs and benefits to their human hosts. (Page 190)
- postmodernist thinkers describe nationalism as a deadly plague (Page 190)
- We call it the Scientific Revolution. It began in western Europe, a large peninsula on the western tip of Afro-Asia, which up till then played no important role in history. (Page 190)
- WERE, SAY, A SPANISH PEASANT TO HAVE fallen asleep in AD 1000 and woken up 500 years later, to the din of Columbus’ sailors boarding the Niña, Pinta and Santa Maria, the world would have seemed to him quite familiar. Despite many changes in technology, manners and political boundaries, this medieval Rip Van Winkle would have felt at home. But had one of Columbus’ sailors fallen into a similar slumber and woken up to the ringtone of a twenty-first-century iPhone, he would have found himself in a world strange beyond comprehension. ‘Is this heaven?’ he might well have asked himself. ‘Or perhaps–hell?’ (Page 193)
- The last 500 years have witnessed a phenomenal and unprecedented growth in human power. (Page 193)
- modern science differs from all previous traditions of knowledge in three critical ways: (Page 195)
- The willingness to admit ignorance. (Page 196)
- The centrality of observation and mathematics. (Page 196)
- The acquisition of new powers. (Page 196)
- The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has been above all a revolution of ignorance. (Page 196)
- Premodern traditions of knowledge such as Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and Confucianism asserted that everything that is important to know about the world was already known. The great gods, or the one almighty God, or the wise people of the past possessed all-encompassing wisdom, (Page 196)
- All modern attempts to stabilise the sociopolitical order have had no choice but to rely on either of two unscientific methods: (Page 198)
- the dominant modern research method takes for granted the insufficiency of old knowledge. Instead of studying old traditions, emphasis is now placed on new observations and experiments. (Page 198)
- When present observation collides with past tradition, we give precedence to the observation. (Page 198)
- Earlier traditions usually formulated their theories in terms of stories. Modern science uses mathematics. (Page 199)
- Only around the end of the nineteenth century did scientists come across a few observations that did not fit well with Newton’s laws, and these led to the next revolutions in physics–the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. (Page 199)
- In 1620 Francis Bacon published a scientific manifesto titled The New Instrument. In it he argued that ‘knowledge is power’. (Page 202)
- Generally speaking, most premodern rulers and business people did not finance research about the nature of the universe in order to develop new technologies, and most thinkers did not try to translate their findings into technological gadgets. Rulers financed educational institutions whose mandate was to spread traditional knowledge for the purpose of buttressing the existing order. (Page 202)
- Science played an even larger role in World War Two. (Page 204)
- Today many Americans believe that the solution to terrorism is technological rather than political. (Page 204)
- Why did it take so long for the deadly potential of this substance to be put to military use? Because it appeared at a time when neither kings, scholars, nor merchants thought that new military technology could save them or make them rich. (Page 205)
- Science, industry and military technology intertwined only with the advent of the capitalist system and the Industrial Revolution. (Page 205)
- Until the Scientific Revolution most human cultures did not believe in progress. They thought the golden age was in the past, and that the world was stagnant, if not deteriorating. (Page 205)
- Many cultures believed that lightning was the hammer of an angry god, used to punish sinners. (Page 206)
- Many cultures have viewed poverty as an inescapable part of this imperfect world. According to the New Testament, shortly before the crucifixion a woman anointed Christ with precious oil worth 300 denarii. Jesus’ disciples scolded the woman for wasting such a huge sum of money instead of giving it to the poor, but Jesus defended her, saying that ‘The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me’ (Mark 14: 7). (Page 207)
- two kinds of poverty: social poverty, which withholds from some people the opportunities available to others; and biological poverty, which puts the very lives of individuals at risk due to lack of food and shelter. Perhaps social poverty can never be eradicated, but in many countries around the world biological poverty is a thing of the past. (Page 207)
- When the gods created man, Gilgamesh had learned, they set death as man’s inevitable destiny, and man must learn to live with it. Disciples of progress do not share this defeatist attitude. For men of science, death is not an inevitable destiny, but merely a technical problem. People die not because the gods decreed it, but due to various technical failures (Page 208)
- As recently as the nineteenth century, the best doctors still did not know how to prevent infection and stop the putrefaction of tissues. (Page 208)
- In the two centuries since Waterloo, things have changed beyond recognition. Pills, injections and sophisticated operations save us from a spate of illnesses and injuries that once dealt an inescapable death sentence. They also protect us against countless daily aches and ailments, which premodern people simply accepted as part of life. The average life expectancy jumped from well below twenty-five to forty years, to around sixty-seven in the entire world, and to around eighty years in the developed world. 8 (Page 209)
- Death suffered its worst setbacks in the arena of child mortality. Until the twentieth century, between a quarter and a third of the children of agricultural societies never reached adulthood. (Page 209)
- The youngest, Edward, was the first of the boys to survive the dangerous years of childhood, and at his father’s death he ascended the English throne as King Edward II. (Page 210)
- The only modern ideology that still awards death a central role is nationalism. (Page 211)
- But if the European powers had not financed geographical, zoological and botanical research around the world, neither Darwin nor Wallace would have had the necessary empirical data to develop the theory of evolution. (Page 212)
- Why did the billions start flowing from government and business coffers into labs and universities? In academic circles, many are naïve enough to believe in pure science. They believe that government and business altruistically give them money to pursue whatever research projects strike their fancy. But this hardly describes the realities of science funding. (Page 212)
- Most scientific studies are funded because somebody believes they can help attain some political, economic or religious goal. (Page 212)
- Even if we wanted to finance pure science unaffected by political, economic or religious interests, it would probably be impossible. (Page 212)
- Science is unable to set its own priorities. (Page 213)
- Two forces in particular deserve our attention: imperialism and capitalism. The feedback loop between science, empire and capital has arguably been history’s chief engine for the past 500 years. (Page 213)
- Its findings made major contributions to a number of disciplines, (Page 215)
- At the time, ships that set sail to distant shores knew that more than half their crew members would die on the journey. (Page 215)
- obvious political and military value. (Page 215)
- The Scientific Revolution and modern imperialism were inseparable. (Page 216)
- Between 1500 and 1750, western Europe gained momentum and became master of the ‘Outer World’, meaning the two American continents (Page 217)
- In 1775 Asia accounted for 80 per cent of the world economy. (Page 217)
- Today all humans are, to a much greater extent than they usually want to admit, European in dress, thought and taste. (Page 218)
- How did the people of this frigid finger of Eurasia manage to break out of their remote corner of the globe and conquer the entire world? Europe’s scientists are often given much of the credit. (Page 218)
- Canned food fed soldiers, railroads and steamships transported soldiers and their provisions, while a new arsenal of medicines cured soldiers, sailors and locomotive engineers. These logistical advances played a more significant role in the European conquest of Africa than did the machine gun. (Page 218)
- Was it so hard for Chinese or Ottomans to engineer steam engines, manufacture machine guns and lay down railroads? (Page 218)
- France and the United States quickly followed in Britain’s footsteps because the French and Americans already shared the most important British myths and social structures. The Chinese and Persians could not catch up as quickly because they thought and organised their societies differently. (Page 219)
- What potential did Europe develop in the early modern period that enabled it to dominate the late modern world? There are two complementary answers to this question: modern science and capitalism. (Page 219)
- The key factor was that the plant-seeking botanist and the colony-seeking naval officer shared a similar mindset. (Page 220)
- Both scientist and conqueror began by admitting ignorance–they both said, ‘I don’t know what’s out there.’ (Page 220)
- Previous seekers of empire tended to assume that they already understood the world. (Page 220)
- The Romans, Mongols and Aztecs voraciously conquered new lands in search of power and wealth–not of knowledge. (Page 220)
- conquest of knowledge and the conquest of territory became ever more tightly intertwined. (Page 220)
- Many cultures drew world maps long before the modern age. (Page 222)
- unfamiliar areas were simply left out, or filled with imaginary monsters and wonders. These maps had no empty spaces. They gave the impression of a familiarity with the entire world. (Page 222)
- The empty maps were a psychological and ideological breakthrough, a clear admission that Europeans were ignorant of large parts of the world. (Page 222)
- On 12 October 1492, at about 2: 00 A.M., Columbus’ expedition collided with the unknown continent. Juan Rodriguez Bermejo, watching from the mast of the ship Pinta, spotted an island in what we now call the Bahamas, (Page 222)
- Could the Bible have missed half the world? (Page 222)
- The first modern man was Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian sailor who took part in several expeditions to America in the years 1499–1504. (Page 223)
- Having drawn it, Waldseemüller had to give it a name. Erroneously believing that Amerigo Vespucci had been the person who discovered it, Waldseemüller named the continent in his honour–America. (Page 224)
- There is poetic justice in the fact that a quarter of the world, and two of its seven continents, are named after a little-known Italian whose sole claim to fame is that he had the courage to say, ‘We don’t know.’ (Page 224)
- favour present observations over past traditions, (Page 224)
- Throughout history most human societies were so busy with local conflicts and neighbourhood quarrels that they never considered exploring and conquering distant lands. (Page 225)
- Columbus’ fleet of 1492–which consisted of three small ships manned by 120 sailors–was like a trio of mosquitoes compared to Zheng He’s drove of dragons. 8 Yet there was a crucial difference. Zheng He explored the oceans, and assisted pro-Chinese rulers, but he did not try to conquer or colonise the countries he visited. (Page 225)
- The Zheng He expeditions prove that Europe did not enjoy an outstanding technological edge. What made Europeans exceptional was their unparalleled and insatiable ambition to explore and conquer. (Page 226)
- The coming of the Spaniards was the equivalent of an alien invasion from outer space. The Aztecs were convinced that they knew the entire world and that they ruled most of it. (Page 227)
- Cortés had no more than 550 Spaniards with him. What could 550 men do to an empire of millions? (Page 228)
- Montezuma continued to behave as if he ruled the empire, and the Aztec elite continued to obey him, which meant they obeyed Cortés. (Page 229)
- Ten years after Cortés landed in Mexico, Pizarro arrived on the shore of the Inca Empire. He had far fewer soldiers than Cortés–his expedition numbered just 168 men! (Page 230)
- Pizarro plagiarised Cortés. He declared himself a peaceful emissary from the king of Spain, invited the Inca ruler, Atahualpa, to a diplomatic interview, and then kidnapped him. (Page 230)
- Even puny European kingdoms such as Scotland and Denmark sent a few explore-and-conquer expeditions to America, but not one expedition of either exploration or conquest was ever sent to America from the Islamic world, India or China. (Page 230)
- The Chinese just weren’t interested. (Page 230)
- Only in the twentieth century did non-European cultures adopt a truly global vision. (Page 230)
- On 10 April 1802 the Great Survey of India was launched. It lasted sixty years. (Page 231)
- British scientific curiosity (Page 231)
- Banks are allowed to loan $ 10 for every dollar they actually possess, (Page 238)
- If all of the account holders at Barclays Bank suddenly demand their money, Barclays will promptly collapse (unless the government steps in to save it). (Page 238)
- What enables banks–and the entire economy–to survive and flourish is our trust in the future. (Page 238)
- with interest. (Page 238)
- In most cases, money could represent and convert only things that actually existed in the present. This imposed a severe limitation on growth, (Page 238)
- a new system based on trust in the future. (Page 239)
- Credit enables us to build the present at the expense of the future. (Page 239)
- The problem in previous eras was not that no one had the idea or knew how to use it. It was that people seldom wanted to extend much credit because they didn’t trust that the future would be better than the present. They generally believed that times past had been better than their own times and that the future would be worse, or at best much the same. (Page 239)
- A Growing Pie (Page 241)
- can increase the sum total of human production, trade and wealth. (Page 241)
- It follows that an increase in the profits of private entrepreneurs is the basis for the increase in collective wealth and prosperity. (Page 242)
- Smith taught people to think about the economy as a ‘win-win situation’, in which my profits are also your profits. (Page 242)
- All this depends, however, on the rich using their profits to open new factories and hire new employees, rather than wasting them on non-productive activities. (Page 243)
- profits ought to be reinvested in production. (Page 243)
- In the new capitalist creed, the first and most sacred commandment is: ‘The profits of production must be reinvested in increasing production.’ (Page 243)
- Capitalism distinguishes ‘capital’ from mere ‘wealth’. Capital consists of money, goods and resources that are invested in production. Wealth, on the other hand, is buried in the ground or wasted on unproductive activities. (Page 243)
- capitalism gradually became far more than just an economic doctrine. It now encompasses an ethic–a set of teachings about how people should behave, educate their children and even think. Its principal tenet is that economic growth is the supreme good, or at least a proxy for the supreme good, because justice, freedom and even happiness all depend on economic growth. (Page 245)
- Over the last few years, banks and governments have been frenziedly printing money. Everybody is terrified that the current economic crisis may stop the growth of the economy. So they are creating trillions of dollars, euros and yen out of thin air, pumping cheap credit into the system, and hoping that the scientists, technicians and engineers will manage to come up with something really big, before the bubble bursts. (Page 245)
- Like a present-day start-up entrepreneur, Columbus did not give up. He pitched his idea to other potential investors in Italy, France, England, and again in Portugal. Each time he was rejected. He then tried his luck with Ferdinand and Isabella, rulers of newly united Spain. He took on some experienced lobbyists, and with their help he managed to convince Queen Isabella to invest. (Page 246)
- The king of Spain desperately needs more money to pay his army. He’s sure that your father has cash to spare. So he brings trumped-up treason charges against your brother. If he doesn’t come up with 20,000 gold coins forthwith, he’ll get cast into a dungeon and rot there until he dies. (Page 248)
- While VOC operated in the Indian Ocean, the Dutch West Indies Company, or WIC, plied the Atlantic. In order to control trade on the important Hudson River, WIC built a settlement called New Amsterdam on an island at the river’s mouth. The colony was threatened by Native Americans and repeatedly attacked by the British, who eventually captured it in 1664. The British changed its name to New York. (Page 250)
- Euphoria swept the streets of Paris. People sold all their possessions and took huge loans in order to buy Mississippi shares. (Page 250)
- The big speculators emerged largely unscathed–they had sold in time. Small investors lost everything, and many committed suicide. (Page 251)
- The Mississippi Bubble was one of history’s most spectacular financial crashes. The royal French financial system never recuperated fully from the blow. (Page 251)
- Like the Dutch Empire before it, the British Empire was established and run largely by private joint-stock companies based in the London stock exchange. (Page 252)
- Western governments were becoming a capitalist trade union. (Page 252)
- constrain the activities of British drug merchants and to compensate them for damages inflicted by the Chinese police. Furthermore, the British demanded and received control of Hong Kong, which they proceeded to use as a secure base for drug trafficking (Hong Kong remained in British hands until 1997). (Page 253)
- Ardent capitalists tend to argue that capital should be free to influence politics, but politics should not be allowed to influence capital. (Page 255)
- is for the government to do as little as possible. This free-market doctrine is today the most common and influential variant of the capitalist creed. (Page 255)
- But in its extreme form, belief in the free market is as naïve as belief in Santa Claus. There simply is no such thing as a market free of all political bias. (Page 255)
- Markets by themselves offer no protection against fraud, theft and violence. It is the job of political systems to ensure trust by legislating sanctions against cheats and to establish and support police forces, courts and jails which will enforce the law. (Page 255)
- In a completely free market, unsupervised by kings and priests, avaricious capitalists can establish monopolies or collude against their workforces. If there is a single corporation controlling all shoe factories in a country, or if all factory owners conspire to reduce wages simultaneously, then the labourers are no longer able to protect themselves by switching jobs. (Page 256)
- During the early modern period, the rise of European capitalism went hand in hand with the rise of the Atlantic slave trade. (Page 256)
- However, growing cane and extracting its sugar was a labour-intensive business. Few people wanted to work long hours in malaria-infested sugar fields under a tropical sun. Contract labourers would have produced a commodity too expensive for mass consumption. Sensitive to market forces, and greedy for profits and economic growth, European plantation owners switched to slaves. (Page 256)
- Most slaves lived a short and miserable life, and millions more died during wars waged to capture slaves or during the long voyage from inner Africa to the shores of America. All this so that Europeans could enjoy their sweet tea and candy–and sugar barons could enjoy huge profits. (Page 256)
- The slave trade was not controlled by any state or government. It was a purely economic enterprise, organised and financed by the free market according to the laws of supply and demand. (Page 256)
- This is the fly in the ointment of free-market capitalism. It cannot ensure that profits are gained in a fair way, or distributed in a fair manner. (Page 257)
- Some religions, such as Christianity and Nazism, have killed millions out of burning hatred. Capitalism has killed millions out of cold indifference coupled with greed. The Atlantic slave trade did not stem from racist hatred towards Africans. The individuals who bought the shares, the brokers who sold them, and the managers of the slave-trade companies rarely thought about the Africans. (Page 257)
- The nineteenth century brought no improvement in the ethics of capitalism. The Industrial Revolution that swept through Europe enriched the bankers and capital-owners, but condemned millions of workers to a life of abject poverty. (Page 257)
- In recent decades, and especially after 1945, capitalist greed was somewhat reined in, not least due to the fear of Communism. Yet inequities are still rampant. The economic pie of 2014 is far larger than the pie of 1500, but it is distributed so unevenly that many African peasants and Indonesian labourers return home after a hard day’s work with less food than did their ancestors 500 years ago. (Page 258)
- capitalism has created a world that nobody but a capitalist is capable of running. (Page 258)
- The only serious attempt to manage the world differently–Communism–was so much worse in almost every conceivable way that nobody has the stomach to try again. (Page 258)
- can the economic pie grow indefinitely? (Page 258)
- THE MODERN ECONOMY GROWS THANKS to our trust in the future and to the willingness of capitalists to reinvest their profits in production. (Page 259)
- But the evidence provided by the past is that they are finite only in theory. Counter-intuitively, while humankind’s use of energy and raw materials has mushroomed in the last few centuries, the amounts available for our exploitation have actually increased. Whenever a shortage of either has threatened to slow economic growth, investments have flowed into scientific and technological research. These have invariably produced not only more efficient ways of exploiting existing resources, but also completely new types of energy and materials. (Page 259)
- The trains moved under the same steam power that had previously pumped water and moved textile looms. A mere twenty years later, Britain had tens of thousands of miles of railway tracks. 1 (Page 261)
- At heart, the Industrial Revolution has been a revolution in energy conversion. (Page 262)
- It has demonstrated again and again that there is no limit to the amount of energy at our disposal. Or, more precisely, that the only limit is set by our ignorance. (Page 262)
- Every few decades we discover a new energy source, so that the sum total of energy at our disposal just keeps growing. (Page 262)
- Only a tiny proportion of the sun’s energy reaches us, yet it amounts to 3,766,800 exajoules of energy each year (Page 262)
- All human activities and industries put together consume about 500 exajoules annually, equivalent to the amount of energy earth receives from the sun in just ninety minutes. (Page 262)
- For decades, aluminium was much more expensive than gold. (Page 263)
- The Industrial Revolution yielded an unprecedented combination of cheap and abundant energy and cheap and abundant raw materials. The result was an explosion in human productivity. (Page 264)
- plants and animals were mechanised. (Page 264)
- farm animals stopped being viewed as living creatures that could feel pain and distress, and instead came to be treated as machines. Today these animals are often mass-produced in factory-like facilities, their bodies shaped in accordance with industrial needs. (Page 264)
- Just as the Atlantic slave trade did not stem from hatred towards Africans, so the modern animal industry is not motivated by animosity. Again, it is fuelled by indifference. Most people who produce and consume eggs, milk and meat rarely stop to think about the fate of the chickens, cows or pigs whose flesh and emissions they are eating. (Page 265)
- monkeys must have psychological needs and desires that go beyond their material requirements, (Page 267)
- Before the industrialisation of agriculture, most of the food produced in fields and farms was ‘wasted’ feeding peasants and farmyard animals. Only a small percentage was available to feed artisans, teachers, priests and bureaucrats. (Page 268)
- Today in the United States, only 2 per cent of the population makes a living from agriculture, yet this 2 per cent produces enough not only to feed the entire US population, but also to export surpluses to the rest of the world. 9 Without the industrialisation of agriculture the urban Industrial Revolution could never have taken place–there would not have been enough hands and brains to staff factories and offices. (Page 268)
- The modern capitalist economy must constantly increase production if it is to survive, (Page 268)
- To prevent this catastrophe and to make sure that people will always buy whatever new stuff industry produces, a new kind of ethic appeared: consumerism. (Page 268)
- Most people throughout history lived under conditions of scarcity. (Page 268)
- Consumerism sees the consumption of ever more products and services as a positive thing. It encourages people to treat themselves, spoil themselves, and even kill themselves slowly by overconsumption. (Page 268)
- Manufacturers deliberately design short-term goods and invent new and unnecessary models of perfectly satisfactory products that we must purchase in order to stay ‘in’. (Page 269)
- Obesity is a double victory for consumerism. Instead of eating little, which will lead to economic contraction, people eat too much and then buy diet products–contributing to economic growth twice over. (Page 269)
- As in previous eras, there is today a division of labour between the elite and the masses. In medieval Europe, aristocrats spent their money carelessly on extravagant luxuries, whereas peasants lived frugally, minding every penny. Today, the tables have turned. The rich take great care managing their assets and investments, while the less well heeled go into debt buying cars and televisions they don’t really need. (Page 269)
- If you took all these people and put them on a large set of scales, their combined mass would be about 300 million tons. If you then took all our domesticated farmyard animals–cows, pigs, sheep and chickens–and placed them on an even larger set of scales, their mass would amount to about 700 million tons. In contrast, the combined mass of all surviving large wild animals–from porcupines and penguins to elephants and whales–is less than 100 million tons. (Page 271)
- The future may see Sapiens gaining control of a cornucopia of new materials and energy sources, while simultaneously destroying what remains of the natural habitat (Page 271)
- The Industrial Revolution turned the timetable and the assembly line into a template for almost all human activities. (Page 273)
- in 1880, the British government took the unprecedented step of legislating that all timetables in Britain must follow Greenwich. For the first time in history, a country adopted a national time and obliged its population to live according to an artificial clock rather than local ones or sunrise-to-sunset cycles. (Page 274)
- The Industrial Revolution brought about dozens of major upheavals in human society. Adapting to industrial time is just one of them. (Page 275)
- the collapse of the family and the local community and their replacement by the state and the market. (Page 275)
- Village life involved many transactions but few payments. (Page 276)
- Life in the bosom of family and community was far from ideal. Families and communities could oppress their members no less brutally than do modern states and markets, and their internal dynamics were often fraught with tension and violence–yet people had little choice. (Page 276)
- Over time, states and markets used their growing power to weaken the traditional bonds of family and community. (Page 277)
- The state and the market approached people with an offer that could not be refused. ‘Become individuals,’ they said. (Page 277)
- You are no longer dependent on your family or your community. We, the state and the market, will take care of you instead. (Page 277)
- The courts, too, see us as individuals, and never punish us for the crimes of our cousins. (Page 277)
- Not only adult men, but also women and children, are recognised as individuals. Throughout most of history, women were often seen as the property of family or community. (Page 277)
- the liberation of the individual comes at a cost. (Page 278)
- In many cases individuals are exploited by markets, (Page 278)
- Yet it is amazing that this deal works at all–however imperfectly. For it breaches countless generations of human social arrangements. (Page 278)
- Millions of years of evolution have designed us to live and think as community members. Within a mere two centuries we have become alienated individuals. (Page 278)
- Markets and states do so by fostering ‘imagined communities’ that contain millions of strangers, and which are tailored to national and commercial needs. An imagined community is a community of people who don’t really know each other, but imagine that they do. (Page 279)
- People tended to reconcile themselves to the status quo, declaring that ‘this is how it always was, and this is how it always will be’. (Page 281)
- Over the last two centuries, the pace of change became so quick that the social order acquired a dynamic and malleable nature. (Page 281)
- Most people don’t appreciate just how peaceful an era we live in. None of us was alive a thousand years ago, so we easily forget how much more violent the world used to be. (Page 282)
- stories. In the year 2000, wars caused the deaths of 310,000 individuals, and violent crime killed another 520,000. Each and every victim is a world destroyed, a family ruined, friends and relatives scarred for life. Yet from a macro perspective these 830,000 victims comprised only 1.5 per cent of the 56 million people who died in 2000. That year 1.26 million people died in car accidents (2.25 per cent of total mortality) and 815,000 people committed suicide (1.45 per cent). 4 (Page 282)
- The figures for 2002 are even more surprising. Out of 57 million dead, only 172,000 people died in war and 569,000 died of violent crime (a total of 741,000 victims of human violence). In contrast, 873,000 people committed suicide. 5 It turns out that in the year following the 9/ 11 attacks, despite all the talk of terrorism and war, the average person was more likely to kill himself than to be killed by a terrorist, a soldier or a drug dealer. (Page 283)
- The decline of violence is due largely to the rise of the state. Throughout history, most violence resulted from local feuds between families and communities. (Page 283)
- Since 1945, no independent country recognised by the UN has been conquered and wiped off the map. Limited international wars still occur from time to time, and millions still die in wars, but wars are no longer the norm. (Page 285)
- real peace is not the mere absence of war. Real peace is the implausibility of war. (Page 285)
- while the price of war soared, its profits declined. (Page 287)
- Today, wealth consists mainly of human capital and organizational know-how. Consequently it is difficult to carry it off or conquer it by military force. (Page 287)
- It is not coincidental that the few full-scale international wars that still take place in the world, such as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, occur in places where wealth is old-fashioned material wealth. (Page 288)
- peace became more lucrative than ever. (Page 288)
- The tightening web of international connections erodes the independence of most countries, lessening the chance that any one of them might single-handedly let slip the dogs of war. (Page 288)
- Most countries no longer engage in full-scale war for the simple reason that they are no longer independent. Though citizens in Israel, Italy, Mexico or Thailand may harbour illusions of independence, the fact is that their governments cannot conduct independent economic or foreign policies, and they are certainly incapable of initiating and conducting full-scale war on their own. (Page 288)
- But are we happier? (Page 290)
- Most current ideologies and political programmes are based on rather flimsy ideas concerning the real source of human happiness. Nationalists believe that political self-determination is essential for our happiness. Communists postulate that everyone would be blissful under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Capitalists maintain that only the free market can ensure the greatest happiness of the greatest number, by creating economic growth and material abundance and by teaching people to be self-reliant and enterprising. (Page 290)
- so far historians have avoided raising these questions–not to mention answering them. They have researched the history of just about everything–politics, society, economics, gender, diseases, sexuality, food, clothing–yet they have seldom stopped to ask how these influence human happiness. (Page 290)
- They argue for a reverse correlation between human capabilities and happiness. (Page 291)
- Nothing in the comfortable lives of the urban middle class can approach the wild excitement and sheer joy experienced by a forager band on a successful mammoth hunt. (Page 291)
- When judging modernity, it is all too tempting to take the viewpoint of a twenty-first-century middle-class Westerner. (Page 292)
- we can congratulate ourselves on the unprecedented accomplishments of modern Sapiens only if we completely ignore the fate of all other animals. (Page 292)
- So far we have discussed happiness as if it were largely a product of material factors, such as health, diet and wealth. (Page 292)
- Perhaps people in modern affluent societies suffer greatly from alienation and meaninglessness despite their prosperity. (Page 292)
- And perhaps our less well-to-do ancestors found much contentment in community, religion and a bond with nature. (Page 292)
- The generally accepted definition of happiness is ‘subjective well-being’. (Page 292)
- money does indeed bring happiness. But only up to a point, and beyond that point it has little significance. (Page 293)
- illness decreases happiness in the short term, but is a source of long-term distress only if a person’s condition is constantly deteriorating or if the disease involves on-going and debilitating pain. People who are diagnosed with chronic illness such as diabetes are usually depressed for a while, but if the illness does not get worse they adjust to their new condition and rate their happiness as highly as healthy people do. (Page 293)
- Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health. (Page 294)
- Marriage is particularly important. (Page 294)
- Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-being, and between bad marriages and misery. (Page 294)
- the freedom we value so highly may be working against us. (Page 294)
- With the individual wielding unprecedented power to decide her own path in life, we find it ever harder to make commitments. (Page 294)
- happiness does not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or even community. Rather, it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations. (Page 294)
- If you want a bullock-cart and get a bullock-cart, you are content. If you want a brand-new Ferrari and get only a second-hand Fiat you feel deprived. (Page 294)
- When things improve, expectations balloon, (Page 294)
- When things deteriorate, expectations shrink, and consequently even a severe illness might leave you pretty much as happy as you were before. (Page 294)
- If happiness depended only on objective conditions such as wealth, health and social relations, it would have been relatively easy to investigate its history. The finding that it depends on subjective expectations makes the task of historians far harder. (Page 294)
- They weren’t comparing themselves to their ancestors under the pharaohs, but rather to their contemporaries in the affluent West. (Page 295)
- In previous eras the standard of beauty was set by the handful of people who lived next door to you. Today the media and the fashion industry expose us to a totally unrealistic standard of beauty. They search out the most gorgeous people on the planet, and then parade them constantly before our eyes. (Page 296)
- our internal biochemical system seems to be programmed to keep happiness levels relatively constant. There’s no natural selection for happiness (Page 297)
- evolution has moulded us to be neither too miserable nor too happy. (Page 297)
- This is true not only of private lives, but also of great collective events. (Page 299)
- despite all the political, social, ideological and economic upheavals brought about by the revolution, its impact on French happiness was small. (Page 299)
- If so, what good was the French Revolution? If people did not become any happier, then what was the point of all that chaos, fear, blood and war? (Page 299)
- Huxley’s world seems monstrous to most readers, but it is hard to explain why. Everybody is happy all the time–what could be wrong with that? (Page 300)
- Huxley’s disconcerting world is based on the biological assumption that happiness equals pleasure. (Page 300)
- He discovered what seems to be a paradox in most people’s view of their lives. Take the work involved in raising a child. Kahneman found that when counting moments of joy and moments of drudgery, bringing up a child turns out to be a rather unpleasant affair. (Page 300)
- Yet most parents declare that their children are their chief source of happiness. (Page 300)
- happiness is not the surplus of pleasant over unpleasant moments. Rather, happiness consists in seeing one’s life in its entirety as meaningful and worthwhile. (Page 300)
- So our medieval ancestors were happy because they found meaning to life (Page 300)
- any meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion. (Page 301)
- The scientist who says her life is meaningful because she increases the store of human knowledge, the soldier who declares that his life is meaningful because he fights to defend his homeland, and the entrepreneur who finds meaning in building a new company are no less delusional than their medieval counterparts who found meaning in reading scriptures, going on a crusade or building a new cathedral. (Page 301)
- So perhaps happiness is synchronising one’s personal delusions of meaning with the prevailing collective delusions. As long as my personal narrative is in line with the narratives of the people around me, I can convince myself that my life is meaningful, and find happiness in that conviction. (Page 301)
- This is quite a depressing conclusion. Does happiness really depend on self-delusion? (Page 301)
- the above views share the assumption that happiness is some sort of subjective feeling (of either pleasure or meaning), (Page 301)
- Liberalism sanctifies the subjective feelings of individuals. It views these feelings as the supreme source of authority. (Page 301)
- Jean-Jacques Rousseau stated this view most classically: ‘What I feel to be good–is good. What I feel to be bad–is bad.’ (Page 301)
- The idea that feelings are not to be trusted is not restricted to Christianity. (Page 302)
- According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather, the real root of suffering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. (Page 303)
- People are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or that fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their feelings, and stop craving them. (Page 303)
- the aim of Buddhist meditation practices. In meditation, you are supposed to closely observe your mind and body, witness the ceaseless arising and passing of all your feelings, and realise how pointless it is to pursue them. (Page 303)
- It is like a man standing for decades on the seashore, embracing certain ‘good’ waves and trying to prevent them from disintegrating, while simultaneously pushing back ‘bad’ waves to prevent them from getting near him. Day in, day out, the man stands on the beach, driving himself crazy with this fruitless exercise. Eventually, he sits down on the sand and just allows the waves to come and go as they please. How peaceful! (Page 303)
- happiness is independent of external conditions. (Page 303)
- Most people wrongly identify themselves with their feelings, thoughts, likes and dislikes. (Page 303)
- More and more spheres of activity are being shaken out of their complacent ways. Lawyers need to rethink issues of privacy and identity; governments are faced with rethinking matters of health care and equality; (Page 314)
- However, with improvements in medical knowledge will come new ethical conundrums. Ethicists and legal experts are already wrestling with the thorny issue of privacy as it relates to DNA. Would insurance companies be entitled to ask for our DNA scans and to raise premiums if they discover a genetic tendency to reckless behaviour? (Page 314)
- Our late modern world prides itself on recognising, for the first time in history, the basic equality of all humans, yet it might be poised to create the most unequal of all societies. (Page 315)
- the future masters of the world will probably be more different from us than we are from Neanderthals. (Page 315)
- We like to believe that in the future people just like us will travel from planet to planet in fast spaceships. We don’t like to contemplate the possibility that in the future, beings with emotions and identities like ours will no longer exist, (Page 316)
- The future is unknown, and it would be surprising if the forecasts of the last few pages were realised in full. History teaches us that what seems to be just around the corner may never materialise due to unforeseen barriers, (Page 316)
- If the curtain is indeed about to drop on Sapiens history, we members of one of its final generations should devote some time to answering one last question: what do we want to become? (Page 316)
- we are doing it to cure diseases and save human lives. (Page 317)
- since we might soon be able to engineer our desires too, the real question facing us is not ‘What do we want to become?’, but ‘What do we want to want?’ (Page 317)
- Unfortunately, the Sapiens regime on earth has so far produced little that we can be proud of. We have mastered our surroundings, increased food production, built cities, established empires and created far-flung trade networks. But did we decrease the amount of suffering in the world? Time and again, massive increases in human power did not necessarily improve the well-being of individual Sapiens, and usually caused immense misery to other animals. (Page 318)
- despite the astonishing things that humans are capable of doing, we remain unsure of our goals and we seem to be as discontented as ever. (Page 318)
- We have advanced from canoes to galleys to steamships to space shuttles–but nobody knows where we’re going. (Page 318)
- seeking little more than our own comfort and amusement, yet never finding satisfaction. (Page 318)
- Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want? (Page 318)
