p28 - "when only the wealthiest in Qin could afford to relive the memories of strangers. Back when it was still rare for
ambulance workers transporting bodies to the morgue to secretly extract the past from deceased citizens, downloading their memories to be delivered to the Towers
for the entertainment of our most privileged."

p36 - "memory artisans"

p64 "The mandate for Censors to review all inherited memories is relatively new..."

p65 - "my fate is sealed. It is a matter of time before my inheritance reaches the top of the Censors' work queue and the Red
Guards arrive at my door. ... I do not deserve to be called a hero for sharing these memories. ... the world had abandoned them, leaving them
no choice but to rebel."

p133 - "Mindbanks are designed to withstand almost any damage, even if I leapt tonight from the roof of my Tower, the scientists could
still Reincarnate me via my device. A suicide attempt would only shine a spotlight on my guilt"

p140 - "Upon entering the simulation, you will be assigned an avatar that befits your legal status. You will use that avatar
to navigate across the Gaokao." Citizen test is a simulation to see how you would behave and how far we'd push ourselves,
through pain, for our civilization.

p183 - "I'm becoming more a vessle of memories than a person..."

p208 - "Is it so strange if we no longer remember how to resist?"
