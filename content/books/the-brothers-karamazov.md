Similar to DFW, _The Brothers Karamazov_ felt 'real', in a different way. But I felt like I knew the brothers. I often don't care about the plot of books.

I enjoy most novels that feel like life. Life is mostly just existing. Life is slow and detailed. I live life in thought.
Similar to DFW, _The Brothers Karamazov_ felt "real", in a different way. But I felt like I knew the brothers. I often
don't care about the plot of books. I care about seeing or experiencing life through a character's life or an author's
life through a character's life. So when a book lacks detail and therefore doesn't feel "real", that's when I'm most
disappointed in a novel.

I didn't really take much away from this novel. But it was an experiential novel and therefore, I enjoyed it.

Life is often about taking it day-by-day and some novels, like this one are about taking it page-by-page or chapter-by-chapter.
There are chapters of life that aren't particularly exciting and therefore, there should be chapters of books that aren't
exciting. That's a beautiful thing.
