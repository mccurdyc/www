## Humans are lazy.

Humans are lazy. That is why many of us aren't particularly great at anything
and why we often associate luck and innate talent with those who are truly great.
Colvin challenges this perspective by offering studies that show greatness doesn't
involve magic, but it does involve passion, persistence and time. Enormous amounts of
all of these things and many people aren't passionate enough and/or not willing
to make the investment. Moreover, it's not as simple as being passionate or willing
to invest the time. It's not just about "putting in the time". The way "the time"
is spent is what differentiates the average from the greats. The greats are particularly
deliberate in what they practice, hence why Colvin defines this form of practice
as "deliberate practice".

However, Colvin suggests that now, more than ever before, _human_ capital is what
companies are interested in to gain a competitive advantage over the competition.

## Deliberate Practice

Deliberate practice --- no matter what it is that one is practicing --- is almost
entirely mental.
