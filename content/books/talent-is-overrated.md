## Humans are lazy.

Generally, humans are lazy and have a finite amount of time and energy. These reasons
are why "The Greats" are minorities in their respective domains. These same reasons
are why even those who are great at _something_, probably sacrifice even being average
at something else. However, we often don't get to see that side. Colvin actually
doesn't mention this, but rather focuses precisely on what makes The Greats, exceptional.

Colvin offers studies that show greatness doesn't involve magic of any kind, but
does involve good timing, passion, persistence and a lot of time. The story of many
greats starts with being introduced to their domain relatively --- compared to the
average age of those in the domain --- early in life by a family member who was
also interested in and able to teach the fundamentals of the domain.

As a brief aside, we often set people up for mediocracy from a very early age,
by telling children how things are, are not and should be. Also at a very young
age is when a person is, often unconsciously, building their mental model of the world.

In order to be great, everyone around that great person also has to have a vested
interested in that person becoming great. They have to be willing to make sacrifices
and also choose to dedicate their life to that person becoming great. Still, in all
cases, it took many years --- often approximately 10 years, hence the "10-year rule" ---
for that person to become identifiably great. Colvin suggests that it's more than
passion and the investment of time. Anyone can be passionate and "put in the time".

Colvin spends a majority of the book talking about how instead of "putting in the time",
one must practice in a state of extreme mental focus in what he calls "deliberate practice".
The biggest challenge in even the most physical domains, is mental.

## Deliberate Practice

Repeated deliberate practice --- no matter what it is that one is practicing --- is almost
entirely mental and so gruelling that one can only endure for a couple hours at a time.
Studies show that mentally we can only endure about 4-5 hours of deliberate practice
per day. One requirement of deliberate practice is that the thing being practiced
be able to be practiced repeatedly with quick feedback.

> Practice with you fingers and you need all day. Practice with your mind and you will do as much in 1 and a half hours. -Leopold Auer

Colvin mentions a study of top violinists who were categorized as "good", "better"
and "best". Of these groups, the differentiating factors were: when they started playing,
the amount of solo, deliberate practice, sleep and time of day when they practiced.
The greats started playing at a younger age and their practice compounded over time,
they understood the importance of sleep and how energy levels affected their ability
to focus during deliberate practice and they often practiced in the morning and early
afternoon (after a nap). In dedicating their lives to their respective domain, The Greats
often scheduled their lives around their practice.

Deliberate practice also often involves a teacher who can see you in ways that you
cannot see yourself. Whether this lack of ability to see ourselves is due to physical
limitations or self-biases. This teacher also often knows when to push you past
your abilities until you are uncomfortable, but still capable. Colvin calls this
"zone" where you are uncomfortable, but still capable, the "learning zone". He identifies
two other zones; the "comfort zone" and the "panic zone". Neither the comfort or panic
zone are ideal for one's learning. Similar to what happens in the panic zone occurs
when goals are unachievable. Top performers have very specific goals and focus on
the process, rather than the outcome.

In the end though, one will only make changes that one believes.
