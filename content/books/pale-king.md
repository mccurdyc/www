p189 "It had something to do with paying attention and the ability to choose what
I paid attention to, and to be aware of that choice, the fact that it's a choice."

p189 "...I think deep down I knew there was more to my life and to myself than
just the ordinary impulses for pleasure..."

p192 "...awareness is different than thinking." "...I believe, in that I do no really
do my most important thinking in large, intentional blocks where I sit down
uninterupted in a chair and know in advance what it is I'm going to think about..."

p193 "It's almost the opposite of awareness, if you think about it. I think this
experience of accidental thinking is common, if perhaps not universal, although
it's not something that you can ever really talk to anyone else about becayse it ends
up being so abstract and hard to explain."

p210 "...he was wise enough to be suspicious of his own desire to seem wise...advice
--- even wise advice --- actually does nothing for the advisee, changes nothing
inside, and can actually cause confusion when the advisee is made to feel the wide gap between
the comparative simplicity of the advice and the totally muddled complication of
his own situation and path."

p214 "Illusion of uniqueness"
"There is someone out there with us in the congregation today that is feeling lost
and hopeless... she had been stunned and deeply moved...instantly felt a huge,
dramatic spiritual change...now suddenly her life had meaning"

p215 "...horoscopes that are specially designed to be so universally obvious that they always
give their horoscope readers...that special eerie feeling of particularity and insight,
exploiting the psychological fact that most people are narcissistic and prone to the
illusion that they and their problems are uniquely special and that if they're feeling
a certain way then surely they're the only person who is feeling like that."

p222 "primed experience"

p230 "To experience commitment as the loss of options, a type of death, the death
of childhood's limitless possibility..."

p230 "...the accounting profession to which you aspire is, in fact, heroic...
Enduring tedium over real time in a confined space is what real courage is...'Gentlemen,
welcome to the world of reality --- there is no audience. No one to applaud, to
admire. No one to see you. Do you understand? Here is the truth --- actual heroism
receives no ovation, entertains no one. No one queues up to see it. No one is interested.'"

p233 "Routine, repetition, tedium, monotony, ephemeracy, inconsequence, abstraction,
disorder, boredom, angst, ennui --- these are the true hero's enemies..."

p234 "'In today's world, boundaries are fixed, and most significant facts have
been generated. Gentlemen, the heroic frontier now lies in the ordering and deployment
of those facts...'"

p249 "...required screening recruits for a set of characteristics that boiled down
to an ability to maintain concentration under conditions of extreme tedium, complication,
confusion, and absense of comprehensive info...looking for 'cogs, no spark plugs.'"

p289 "'...we're just so extremely pleased to have you on board'...not only was
it surprising to be greeted in person with such enthusiastic words, but it was
doubly surprising when the person reciting these words displayed the same kind of
disengagement as, say, the checkout clerk who utters the words 'Have a nice day'
while her expression indicates that it's really a matter of of total indifference
to her whether you drop dead in the parking lot outside ten seconds from now."

p294 "...these were people who did not fidget..." They are dead!

p295 "...America had some vested economic interest in keeping people over-stimulated
and unused to silence and single-point concentration."

p342 "'Your job, in a sense, with each file is to separate the valuable, pertinent
information from the pointless information.'"

p345 "'...Avoid the temptation to think that you always need more information. You
can drown in it.'

p370 predictability over superiority or over-achievement

p383 "He imagined that the clock's second hand possessed awareness and knew that
it was a second hand and that its job was to go around and around inside a circle
of numbers forever at the same slow unvarying machinelike rate, going no place it
hadn't already been a million times before..."

p390 we teach our kids as infants to need stimulation.

p398 "...the heady enthusiam of childhood had given way in the boy to a realization
that the objective of pressing his lips to every square inch of himself was going
to require maximum effort, discipline, and a commitment sustainable over periods
of time he could not then (because of his age) imagine." The beauty of naevety.

p439 "...life owes you nothing..."

p440 The key to life is to be able to endure boredom. "If you are immune to boredom,
there is literally nothing you cannot accomplish."

p470 psych hospital "'I was a _cutter_... I didn't know what I did it. I'm still
not sure, except he taught me that trying to analyze it or understand all the whys
was bullshit...The doctors were a joke...Even the ones who you could halfway see
might be human beings were more interested in your case, not in you...If you said
you hated it there and it wasn't helping and you wanted to leave, they saw it as
a symptom of your case, not as you wanting to leave. It was like you weren't a human
being, you were a piece of machinery that could take apart and figure out how it
worked..."

p479 "...one of the weird things about being in a psych hospital is you gradually
start to feel like you have permission to say whatever you're thinking...no more
smilely masks, no more pretending..."

p490 institutional structure. machine of the institution

p500 You have to own your issues. "...there is a particular kind of stage of life where
you get cut off from the, like, unself-conscious happiness and magic of childhood..."
