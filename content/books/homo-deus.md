- The same three problems preoccupied the people of twentieth-century China, of medieval India and of ancient Egypt. Famine, plague and war ([Location 8092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8092))
- Most people rarely think about it, but in the last few decades we have managed to rein in famine, plague and war. ([Location 8097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8097))
- In a healthy, prosperous and harmonious world, what will demand our attention and ingenuity? ([Location 8110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8110))
- When severe drought hit ancient Egypt or medieval India, it was not uncommon that 5 or 10 per cent of the population perished. Provisions became scarce; transport was too slow and expensive to import sufficient food; and governments were far too weak to save the day. ([Location 8121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8121))
- About 2.8 million French – 15 per cent of the population – starved to death between 1692 and 1694, ([Location 8132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8132))
- Half of humankind is expected to be overweight by 2030. ([Location 8166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8166))
- Until the modern era, humans blamed diseases on bad air, malicious demons and angry gods, ([Location 8184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8184))
- Epidemics continued to kill tens of millions of people well into the twentieth century. In January 1918 soldiers in the trenches of northern France began dying in the thousands from a particularly virulent strain of flu, nicknamed ‘the Spanish Flu’. ([Location 8216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8216))
- In India it killed 5 per cent of the population ([Location 8221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8221))
- New infectious diseases appear mainly as a result of chance mutations in pathogen genomes. These mutations allow the pathogens to jump from animals to humans, ([Location 8269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8269))
- In 2015 doctors announced the discovery of a completely new type of antibiotic – teixobactin – to which bacteria have no resistance as yet. ([Location 8278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8278))
- So while we cannot be certain that some new Ebola outbreak or an unknown flu strain won’t sweep across the globe and kill millions, we will not regard it as an inevitable natural calamity. Rather, we will see it as an inexcusable human failure and demand the heads of those responsible. ([Location 8284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8284))
- The era when humankind stood helpless before natural epidemics is probably over. But we may come to miss it. ([Location 8298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8298))
- In 2012 about 56 million people died throughout the world; 620,000 of them died due to human violence (war killed 120,000 people, and crime killed another 500,000). In contrast, 800,000 committed suicide, and 1.5 million died of diabetes. <mark>Sugar is now more dangerous than gunpowder.</mark> ([Location 8309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8309))
- Nuclear weapons have turned war between superpowers into a mad act of collective suicide, and therefore forced the most powerful nations on earth to find alternative and peaceful ways to resolve conflicts. ([Location 8313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8313))
- This New Peace is not just a hippie fantasy. Power-hungry governments and greedy corporations also count on it. ([Location 8332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8332))
- There is no guarantee, of course, that the New Peace will hold indefinitely. ([Location 8339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8339))
- <mark>Just as nuclear weapons made the New Peace possible in the first place, so future technological developments might set the stage for new kinds of war. ([Location 8340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8340))</mark>
- <mark>However, we should not confuse ability with motivation. Though cyber warfare introduces new means of destruction, it doesn’t necessarily add new incentives to use them. ([Location 8346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8346))</mark>
- terrorism is a strategy of weakness adopted by those who lack access to real power. At least in the past, terrorism worked by spreading fear rather than by causing significant material damage. ([Location 8358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8358))
- <mark>For the average American or European, Coca-Cola poses a far deadlier threat than al-Qaeda. ([Location 8362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8362))</mark>
- terrorism is a show. ([Location 8364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8364))
- Terrorists stage a terrifying spectacle of violence that captures our <mark>imagination</mark> ([Location 8364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8364))
- it all depends on our reactions. If the Jungle Law comes back into force, it will not be the fault of terrorists. ([Location 8373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8373))
- The message is not that famine, plague and war have completely disappeared from the face of the earth, and that we should stop worrying about them. Just the opposite. ([Location 8377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8377))
- Acknowledging our past achievements sends a message of hope and responsibility, encouraging us to make even greater efforts in the future. ([Location 8384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8384))
- if people continue to suffer from famine, plague and war, we cannot blame it on nature or on God. It is within our power to make things better and to reduce the incidence of suffering even further. ([Location 8385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8385))
- What are the projects that will replace famine, plague and war at the top of the human agenda in the twenty-first century? ([Location 8390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8390))
- One central project will be to protect humankind and the planet as a whole from the dangers inherent in our own power. ([Location 8391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8391))
- this same growth destabilises the ecological equilibrium of the planet in myriad ways, which we have only begun to explore. ([Location 8393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8393))
- When the moment comes to choose between economic growth and ecological stability, politicians, CEOs and voters almost always prefer growth. ([Location 8396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8396))
- Success breeds ambition, ([Location 8403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8403))
- <mark>In the twenty-first century humans are likely to make a serious bid for immortality. ([Location 8409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8409))</mark>
- We are constantly reminded that human life is the most sacred thing in the universe. Everybody says this: teachers in schools, politicians in parliaments, lawyers in courts and actors on theatre stages. ([Location 8410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8410))
- <mark>Throughout history, religions and ideologies did not sanctify life itself. They always sanctified something above or beyond earthly existence, and were consequently quite tolerant of death. ([Location 8415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8415))</mark>
- humans don’t die because a figure in a black cloak taps them on the shoulder, or because God decreed it, or because mortality is an essential part of some great cosmic plan. Humans always die due to some technical glitch. ([Location 8428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8428))
- defeat death ([Location 8457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8457))
  - Note: how does this affect the system though? Is the system setup to handle this? We are focused on solving the immediate technical problem, but what about how immortality affects the system that the world operates under.
- Google Ventures is investing 36 per cent of its $2 billion portfolio in life sciences start-ups, including several ambitious life-extending projects. ([Location 8462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8462))
- According to Kurzweil and de Grey, every ten years or so we will march into the clinic and receive a makeover treatment that will not only cure illnesses, but will also regenerate decaying tissues, and upgrade hands, eyes and brains. ([Location 8474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8474))
- In truth they will actually be <mark>a-mortal, rather than immortal.</mark> Unlike God, future superhumans could still die in some war or accident, and nothing could bring them back from the netherworld. ([Location 8478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8478))
- Which will probably make them the most anxious people in history. We mortals daily take chances with our lives, because we know they are going to end anyhow. ([Location 8481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8481))
- Perhaps, then, we had better start with more modest aims, such as doubling life expectancy? ([Location 8484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8484))
- In the twentieth century we have almost doubled life expectancy from forty to seventy, so in the twenty-first century we should at least be able to double it again to 150. ([Location 8485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8485))
- Though falling far short of immortality, this would still revolutionise human society. For starters, family structure, marriages and child–parent relationships would be transformed. ([Location 8486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8486))
- At the same time, people will not retire at sixty-five and will not make way for the new generation with its novel ideas and aspirations. ([Location 8496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8496))
- The physicist Max Planck famously said that <mark>science advances one funeral at a time. He meant that only when one generation passes away do new theories have a chance to root out old ones. ([Location 8497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8497))</mark>
- My own view is that the hopes of eternal youth in the twenty-first century are premature, and whoever takes them too seriously is in for a bitter disappointment. It is not easy to live knowing that you are going to die, but it is even harder to believe in immortality and be proven wrong. ([Location 8506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8506))
- In truth, so far modern medicine hasn’t extended our natural life span by a single year. Its great achievement has been to save us from premature death, ([Location 8514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8514))
- Even if we now overcome cancer, diabetes and the other major killers, it would mean only that almost everyone will get to live to ninety – but it will not be enough to reach 150, let alone 500. ([Location 8516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8516))
- the needs of the capitalist economy, a relentless war against death seems to be inevitable. ([Location 8526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8526))
- Most scientists and bankers don’t care what they are working on, provided it gives them an opportunity to make new discoveries and greater profits. ([Location 8529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8529))
- People want to live for ever, so they compose an ‘immortal’ symphony, they strive for ‘eternal glory’ in some war, or even sacrifice their lives ([Location 8536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8536))
- Eternal glory, nationalist remembrance ceremonies and dreams of paradise are very poor substitutes for what humans like Allen really want – not to die. ([Location 8541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8541))
- <mark>If and when science makes significant progress in the war against death, the real battle will shift from the laboratories to the parliaments, courthouses and streets. ([Location 8545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8545))</mark>
- Once the scientific efforts are crowned with success, they will trigger bitter political conflicts. All the wars and conflicts of history might turn out to be but a pale prelude for the real struggle ahead of us: the struggle for eternal youth. ([Location 8546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8546))
- The second big project on the human agenda will probably be to find the key to happiness. ([Location 8549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8549))
- At the end of the eighteenth century the British philosopher Jeremy Bentham declared that the supreme good is ‘the greatest happiness of the greatest number’, and concluded that the sole worthy aim of the state, the market and the scientific community is to increase global happiness. Politicians should make peace, business people should foster prosperity and scholars should study nature, not for the greater glory of king, country or God – but so that you and I could enjoy a happier life. ([Location 8557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8557))
- Schools were founded to produce skilful and obedient citizens who would serve the nation loyally. At eighteen, youths needed to be not only patriotic but also literate, so that they could read the brigadier’s order of the day and draw up tomorrow’s battle plans. ([Location 8565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8565))
- The aim wasn’t to make people happy, but to make the nation stronger. ([Location 8573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8573))
- It’s important to note, however, that the American Declaration of Independence guaranteed the right to the pursuit of happiness, not the right to happiness itself. Crucially, Thomas Jefferson did not make the state responsible for its citizens’ happiness. ([Location 8580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8580))
- <mark>The right to the pursuit of happiness, originally envisaged as a restraint on state power, has imperceptibly morphed into the right to happiness</mark> – as if human beings have a natural right to be happy, and anything which makes us dissatisfied is a violation of our basic human rights, so the state should do something about it. ([Location 8588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8588))
- nowadays thinkers, politicians and even economists are calling to supplement or even replace GDP with GDH – gross domestic happiness. After all, what do people want? They don’t want to produce. They want to be happy. ([Location 8593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8593))
- When Epicurus defined happiness as the supreme good, he warned his disciples that it is hard work to be happy. ([Location 8600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8600))
- Material achievements alone will not satisfy us for long. ([Location 8601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8601))
- Epicurus recommended, for example, to eat and drink in moderation, and to curb one’s sexual appetites. ([Location 8602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8602))
- <mark>In Peru, Guatemala, the Philippines and Albania – developing countries suffering from poverty and political instability – about one person in 100,000 commits suicide each year. In rich and peaceful countries such as Switzerland, France, Japan and New Zealand, twenty-five people per 100,000 take their own lives annually. ([Location 8607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8607))</mark>
- attaining positive happiness may be far more difficult than abolishing downright suffering. ([Location 8621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8621))
- It took just a piece of bread to make a starving medieval peasant joyful. How do you bring joy to a bored, overpaid and overweight engineer? ([Location 8622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8622))
- On the psychological level, happiness depends on expectations rather than objective conditions. ([Location 8636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8636))
- <mark>We don’t become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. ([Location 8637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8637))</mark>
- <mark>as conditions improve, expectations balloon. ([Location 8638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8638))</mark>
- Dramatic improvements in conditions, as humankind has experienced in recent decades, translate into greater expectations rather than greater contentment. ([Location 8638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8638))
- happiness and suffering are nothing but different balances of bodily sensations. ([Location 8648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8648))
- Some may say that this is not so bad, because it isn’t the goal that makes us happy – it’s the journey. ([Location 8684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8684))
- Humans too may prefer the excitement of the race to resting on the laurels of success. ([Location 8694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8694))
- Yet what makes the race so attractive is the exhilarating sensations that go along with it. ([Location 8695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8695))
- the exciting sensations of the race are as transient as the blissful sensations of victory. ([Location 8698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8698))
- Perhaps the key to happiness is neither the race nor the gold medal, but rather combining the right doses of excitement and tranquillity; ([Location 8702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8702))
- increasing numbers of schoolchildren take stimulants such as Ritalin. ([Location 8709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8709))
- Maybe we should modify the schools rather than the kids? ([Location 8715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8715))
- The biochemical pursuit of happiness is also the number one cause of crime in the world. ([Location 8726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8726))
- In 2009 half of the inmates in US federal prisons got there because of drugs; 38 per cent of Italian prisoners were convicted of drug-related offences; 55 per cent of inmates in the UK reported that they committed their crimes in connection with either consuming or trading drugs. A 2001 report found that 62 per cent of Australian convicts were under the influence of drugs when committing the crime for which they were incarcerated. ([Location 8726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8726))
- People drink alcohol to forget, they smoke pot to feel peaceful, they take cocaine and methamphetamines to be sharp and confident, whereas Ecstasy provides ecstatic sensations and LSD sends you to meet Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. ([Location 8729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8729))
- This is an existential threat to the social and economic order, ([Location 8732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8732))
- Some 2,300 years ago Epicurus warned his disciples that immoderate <mark>pursuit of pleasure is likely to make them miserable rather than happy. ([Location 8746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8746))</mark>
- <mark>A couple of centuries earlier Buddha had made an even more radical claim, teaching that the pursuit of pleasant sensations is in fact the very root of suffering. ([Location 8747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8747))</mark>
- the mere memory of past pleasures will not satisfy me, I have to start all over again. ([Location 8752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8752))
- <mark>To attain real happiness, humans need to slow down the pursuit of pleasant sensations, not accelerate it. ([Location 8754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8754))</mark>
- ephemeral and meaningless vibrations ([Location 8761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8761))
- once technology enables us to re-engineer human minds, Homo sapiens will disappear, human history will come to an end and a completely new kind of process will begin, which people like you and me cannot comprehend. ([Location 8826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8826))
- our present-day minds cannot grasp what might happen next. ([Location 8832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8832))
- Certain traditional abilities that were considered divine for many millennia have today become so commonplace that we hardly think about them. ([Location 8844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8844))
- In ancient agricultural societies, many religions displayed surprisingly little interest in metaphysical questions and the afterlife. ([Location 8852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8852))
- In pursuit of health, happiness and power, humans will gradually change first one of their features and then another, and another, until they will no longer be human. ([Location 8875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8875))
- when they hear of upgraded superhumans, they say: ‘I hope I will be dead before that happens.’ ([Location 8879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8879))
- in an upgraded world you will feel like a Neanderthal ([Location 8883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8883))
- our world of meaning might collapse within decades. ([Location 8885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8885))
- Scientific research and technological developments are moving at a far faster rate than most of us can grasp. ([Location 8887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8887))
- <mark>Since no one understands the system any more, no one can stop it. ([Location 8910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8910))</mark>
- <mark>if we somehow succeed in hitting the brakes, our economy will collapse, along with our society. As explained in a later chapter, the modern economy needs constant and indefinite growth in order to survive. ([Location 8911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8911))</mark>
- Given our past record and our current values, we are likely to reach out for bliss, divinity and immortality – even if it kills us. ([Location 8991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8991))
- History is often shaped by exaggerated hopes. ([Location 8992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8992))
- prediction is less of a prophecy and more a way of discussing our present choices. ([Location 8996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8996))
- If the discussion makes us choose differently, so that the prediction is proven wrong, all the better. ([Location 8997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=8997))
- <mark>Knowledge that does not change behaviour is useless. ([Location 9022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9022))</mark>
- <mark>Centuries ago human knowledge increased slowly, so politics and economics changed at a leisurely pace too. Today our knowledge is increasing at breakneck speed, and theoretically we should understand the world better and better. But the very opposite is happening. Our new-found knowledge leads to faster economic, social and political changes; in an attempt to understand what is happening, we accelerate the accumulation of knowledge, which leads only to faster and greater upheavals.

- Yet I would now like to place something else on the table: a gun. A gun that appears in Act I, to fire in Act III. The following chapters discuss how humanism – the worship of humankind – has conquered the world. ([Location 9128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9128))

- Not long ago psychologists doubted the importance of the emotional bond between parents and children even among humans. ([Location 9460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9460))
- In the first half of the twentieth century, and despite the influence of Freudian theories, the dominant behaviourist school argued that relations between parents and children were shaped by material feedback; that children needed mainly food, shelter and medical care; and that children bonded with their parents simply because the latter provide these material needs. ([Location 9461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9461))
- farmers throughout history took care of the material needs of piglets, calves and kids, but tended to ignore their emotional needs. ([Location 9486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9486))

- People today imagine the ancient temple in Jerusalem as a kind of big synagogue where priests clad in snow-white robes welcomed devout pilgrims, melodious choirs sang psalms and incense perfumed the air. In reality, it looked more like a cross between a slaughterhouse and a barbecue joint. ([Location 9500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9500))

- In the new theist drama Sapiens became the central hero around whom the entire universe revolved. ([Location 9518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9518))
- Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism, have demonstrated even greater empathy to animals. They emphasise the connection between humans and the rest of the ecosystem, and their foremost ethical commandment has been to avoid killing any living being. ([Location 9564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9564))
- Nevertheless, all agricultural religions – Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism included – found ways to justify human superiority and the exploitation of animals (if not for meat, then for milk and muscle power). ([Location 9569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9569))
- The Agricultural Revolution was thus both an economic and a religious revolution. ([Location 9584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9584))
- New kinds of economic relations emerged together with new kinds of religious beliefs that justified the brutal exploitation of animals. ([Location 9585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9585))
- The degradation of animals from sentient beings deserving of respect into mere property rarely stopped with cows and chickens. Most agricultural societies began treating various classes of people as if they too were property. ([Location 9594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9594))
- rulers did not dream of asking peasants for their opinions about running the kingdom. ([Location 9597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9597))
- when ethnic groups or religious communities clashed, they frequently dehumanized each other. ([Location 9598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9598))
- The farm thus became the prototype of new societies, ([Location 9599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9599))
- During the Agricultural Revolution humankind silenced animals and plants, and turned the animist grand opera into a dialogue between man and gods. During the Scientific Revolution humankind silenced the gods too. The world was now a one-man show. ([Location 9603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9603))
- Whereas the Agricultural Revolution gave rise to theist religions, the Scientific Revolution gave birth to humanist religions, in which humans replaced gods. ([Location 9628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9628))
- Whereas theism justified traditional agriculture in the name of God, humanism has justified modern industrial farming in the name of Man. ([Location 9633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9633))
- If an ambitious peasant had tried to confine thousands of animals in a crowded coop, a deadly epidemic would probably have resulted, wiping out all the animals as well as many of the villagers. ([Location 9640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9640))
- In recent years, as people began to rethink human–animal relations, such practices have come under increasing criticism. We are suddenly showing unprecedented interest in the fate of so-called lower life forms, perhaps because we are about to become one. ([Location 9645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9645))
- American lives are more valued. ([Location 9663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9663))

- What is this unique human spark? ([Location 9670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9670))
- The traditional monotheist answer is that only Sapiens have eternal souls. ([Location 9671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9671))
- There is zero scientific evidence that in contrast to pigs, Sapiens have souls. ([Location 9682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9682))
- According to a 2012 Gallup survey, only 15 per cent of Americans think that Homo sapiens evolved through natural selection alone, free of all divine intervention; 32 per cent maintain that humans may have evolved from earlier life forms in a process lasting millions of years, but God orchestrated this entire show; 46 per cent believe that God created humans in their current form sometime during the last 10,000 years, just as the Bible says. ([Location 9688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9688))
- Spending three years in college has absolutely no impact on these views. The same survey found that among BA graduates, 46 per cent believe in the biblical creation story, whereas only 14 per cent think that humans evolved without any divine supervision. Even among holders of MA and PhD degrees, 25 per cent believe the Bible, whereas only 29 per cent credit natural selection alone with the creation of our species. ([Location 9691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9691))
- That’s why the theory of evolution cannot accept the idea of souls, at least if by ‘soul’ we mean something indivisible, immutable and potentially eternal. Such an entity cannot possibly result from a step-by-step evolution. Natural selection could produce a human eye, because the eye has parts. But the soul has no parts. ([Location 9729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9729))

- only unconscious algorithms rather than subjective experiences? ([Location 9767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9767))
- To be frank, science knows surprisingly little about mind and consciousness. Current orthodoxy holds that consciousness is created by electrochemical reactions in the brain, and that mental experiences fulfil some essential data-processing function.

- If a chain of electrochemical reactions leads all the way from the nerve cells in the eye to the movements of leg muscles, why add subjective experiences to this chain? What do they do? ([Location 9836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9836))
- What are all these memories, imaginations and thoughts? Where do they exist? According to current biological theories, our memories, imaginations and thoughts don’t exist in some higher immaterial field. Rather, they too are avalanches of electric signals fired by billions of neurons. ([Location 9847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9847))

- Maybe the mind should join the soul, God and ether in the dustbin of science? ([Location 9904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9904))
- few ethical dilemmas can be solved by referring strictly to brain activities. ([Location 9915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9915))
- some scientists concede that consciousness is real and may actually have great moral and political value, but that it fulfils no biological function whatsoever. ([Location 9920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9920))
- Consciousness is the biologically useless by-product of certain brain processes. Jet engines roar loudly, but the noise doesn’t propel the aeroplane forward. Humans don’t need carbon dioxide, but each and every breath fills the air with more of the stuff. ([Location 9921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9921))
- <mark>consciousness may be a kind of mental pollution produced by the firing of complex neural networks. It doesn’t do anything. It is just there. ([Location 9923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9923))</mark>
- If this is true, it implies that all the pain and pleasure experienced by billions of creatures for millions of years is just mental pollution. ([Location 9924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9924))
- when humans tried to explain life, they assumed it must work according to analogous principles. ([Location 9930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9930))
- In the twenty-first century it sounds childish to compare the human psyche to a steam engine. Today we know of a far more sophisticated technology – the computer – so we explain the human psyche as if it were a computer processing data rather than a steam engine regulating pressure.

- this new analogy may turn out to be just as naïve. ([Location 9942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=9942))
- If the patient’s brain displays the telltale signatures of consciousness, he is probably conscious, even though he cannot move or speak. Indeed, doctors have recently managed to communicate with such patients using fMRI imaging. They ask the patients yes/no questions, telling them to imagine themselves playing tennis if the answer is yes, and to visualise the location of their home if the answer is no.

- If cooperation is the key, how come the ants and bees did not beat us to the nuclear bomb even though they learned to cooperate en masse millions of years before us? Because their cooperation lacks flexibility. Bees cooperate in very sophisticated ways, but they cannot reinvent their social system overnight. If a hive faces a new threat or a new opportunity, the bees cannot, for example, guillotine the queen and establish a republic.

- today we have a detailed albeit imperfect map of the sub-normative mental spectrum: the zone of human existence characterized by less-than-normal capacities to feel, think or communicate. Simultaneously, scientists have studied the mental states of people considered to be healthy and normative. However, most scientific research about the human mind and the human experience has been conducted on people from Western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic (WEIRD) societies, who do not constitute a representative sample of humanity. ([Location 13665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=13665))
- in papers published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology – arguably the most important journal in the subfield of social psychology – 96 per cent of the sampled individuals were WEIRD, and 68 per cent were Americans. Moreover, 67 per cent of American subjects and 80 per cent of non-American subjects were psychology students!

- One of the most important articles about the philosophy of mind is titled ‘What Is It Like to Be a Bat?’3 In this 1974 paper, the philosopher Thomas Nagel points out that a Sapiens mind cannot fathom the subjective world of a bat. We can write all the algorithms we want about the bat body, bat echolocation systems and bat neurons, but that won’t tell us how it feels to be a bat.

- Heavy taxation means that a large part of all available capital accumulates in one place – the state coffers – and consequently more and more decisions have to be made by a single processor, namely the government. This creates an overly centralised data-processing system. ([Location 13924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=13924))
- in which all data is processed and all decisions are made by a single central processor, is called communism. In a communist economy people allegedly work according to their abilities and receive according to their needs. In other words, the government takes 100 per cent of your profits, decides what you need and then supplies these needs. ([Location 13930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=13930))
- Capitalism did not defeat communism because capitalism was more ethical, because individual liberties are sacred or because God was angry with the heathen communists.

Dictatorships use centralised processing methods, whereas democracies prefer distributed processing. ([Location 13973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NH9R8FK&location=13973))
