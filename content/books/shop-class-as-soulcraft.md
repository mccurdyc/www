I honestly thought this was going to be another one of those books where there
was a really well-written, clear, introduction that made all of the points the
author had and that the rest of the book was going to just be repitition of those
points; but it wasn't.

Also, interestingly, I was watching a conversation between Steve-O and Steve Wozniak
(yes, I primarily watched it because it was a weird combination). And as I was
reading the part of the book about "agency vs autonomy", I also was at the point
in the video where [Woz talked about this in regards to computers](https://youtu.be/CRi8r0XQFHU?t=651).
