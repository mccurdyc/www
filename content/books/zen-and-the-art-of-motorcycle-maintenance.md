> The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands,
and then work outward from there.

> If you have a high evaluation of yourself then your ability to recognize new facts
is weakened. You ego isolates you from Quality reality.

> [...] most people stand in sight of the spiritual mountains all their lives and
never enter them, being content to list to other who have been there and thus avoid
the hardships. Some travel into the mountains accompanied by experienced guides who
know the best and least dangerous routes by which they arrive at their destination.
Still others, inexperienced and untrusting, attempt to make their own routes.

> Stuckness shouldn't be avoided. It's the psychic predecessor of all real understanding.

> [...] physical discomfort is only important when the mood is wrong.

## Quality

Quality is contagious.

> [...] Quality tends to fan out like waves. The Quality job he didn't think anyone was
going to see is seen, and the person who sees it feels a little better because of it,
and is likely to pass that feeling on to others.

> Applied science and technology would be drastically changed [by a Quality-less world],
but pure science, mathematics, philosophy and particularly logic would be unchanged.

The narrator also talks about what he calls "squareness", which is what you get when
you subtract Quality from something.

Defining Quality is a main theme throughout the book and I still feel like I
didn't fully grasp it in it's entirety. Much of the journey and struggle in the
book is around defining Quality. Is it defined objectively or subjectively? Personally,
I think it is both. Objectively, does it do its job? Subjectively, does it do
it well, for _you_, for _them_?

For example, think of a really well-designed and colorful website. Maybe _you_
consider this a "high-Quality" website, but to someone who is colorblind, this
site may be extremely hard to navigate and therefore, to _them_ it is "low-Quality".

> Quality is what _you_ like.

The "System" teaches us to do what _others_ like.

> Quality is not a _thing_. It is an _event_. [...] It is an event at which the subject
becomes aware of the object.

> Peace of mind isn't at all superficial [...]. It's the whole thing. That which produces
it is good maintenance; that which disturbs it is poor maintenance. What we call workability
of the machine is just and objectification of this peace of mind. The ultimate test's
always your own serenity. If you don't have this when you start and maintain it while
you're working you're likely to build your personal problems right into the machine itself.

> The test of the machine is the satisfaction it gives you [...]. If the machine produces
tranquility it's right. If it disturbs you it is wrong until either the machine or
you mind [(i.e., your mental model)] is changed.

The above quote reminds me of a book called [The Design of Everyday Things by  Donald A. Norman](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-design-of-everyday-things_donald-a-norman/246934/?mkwid=2tFK5nbD|dc&pcrid=77584311782996&pkw=the%20design%20of%20everyday%20things&pmt=be&slid=&product=&plc=&pgrid=3093486911&ptaid=kwd-23347852414:loc-190&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Search%20%7C%20Titles%20%7C%20D&utm_term=the%20design%20of%20everyday%20things&utm_content=2tFK5nbD|dc|pcrid|77584311782996|pkw|the%20design%20of%20everyday%20things|pmt|be|product||slid||pgrid|3093486911|ptaid|kwd-23347852414:loc-190|&msclkid=ef9c96096b7619e64228c8b827bd4408#isbn=0385267746&idiq=1852536).
I haven't read the book in it's entirety, but I remember it talking about things
that cause blips in our minds, such as a door handle that looks like it should
be pushed, but the door operates by pulls.

I know my wife and sister would laugh if they read this because when I'm struggling
with something because it doesn't operate as I unconsciously think it should, I call
it a "piece of junk".

> Quality is not the _result_ of the collision between subject and object, it is the
_cause_ of the subject and object.

I interpret this as we only truly notice the Quality of an object when either the
object does its job extremely well or poorly compared to previous experiences with
related objects. Otherwise, we do not become consciously aware of the Quality of
and object. Quality is the unifying force between subject and object.

> People differ about Quality, not because Quality is different, but because people
are different in terms of experience.

> Such personal transcendence of conflicts with technology doesn't have to involve
motorcycles, of course. It can be at a level as simple as sharpening a kitchen knife
or sewing a dress or mending a broken chair. The underlying problems are the same. In
each case there's a beautiful way of doing it and an ugly way of doing it, and in arriving
at the high-quality, beautiful way of doing it, both an ability to see what "looks good"
and an ability to understand the underlying method to arrive at the "good" are needed.
Both classic and romantic understandings of Quality must be combined.

### "Fake" Quality

When Quality is taught or forced and not learned or discovered by oneself through trial
and tribulation, it is unappreciated, "fake" Quality.

> It is the little, pathetic attempts at Quality that kill.

> [...] there is nothing here but dead neon and cement and brick.

Once you define or teach Quality, it no longer fully exists. To truly exists in full
form, Quality must be discovered. It is with passion, gumption, persistence and
the right attitude that help discover true Quality.

### Quality versus reason

> [Our culture has the tendency] to do what is "reasonable" even when it isn't any good.

> Reason and Quality had become separated and in conflict with each other and Quality
had been forced under and reason made supreme [...]

The narrator talks about this conflict between reason --- i.e., "the facts" --- and
quality --- i.e., the attitude toward and intimacy with something. Reason is forced
upon us by society and institutions. We aren't given the opportunity to discover
Quality intimately on our own. We are told what Quality is.

> The Church of Reason, like all institutions of the System, is based not on individual
strength but upon individual weakness. What's really demanded in the Church of Reason
is not _ability_, but _inability_.

In the Aristotelian ways, as a student, you are expected to be a carbon copy of your
teacher, who is a copy of their teacher and so on, clear back to Aristotle himself.

> Quality for sheep is what the shepherd says.

When Quality is not discovered, but told, one will encounter extreme fear when in
a situation where they aren't given the answer.

> [...] if you take a sheep and put it up at the timberline at night when the wind
is roaring, the sheep will be panicked half to death and will call and call until the
shepherd comes, or comes the wolf.

## Attitude

The "spectator" attitude is when you don't intimately care about the thing or what
you are doing, you just want to get it done or for it to "just work".

While the author mostly focuses on internal attitude towards the work that one
does, I think it is important to mention that the way the work is "prescribed" is
also important. If what one is asked to do is discussed as important or influential
work, then one will be more motivated to spend more effort on the task.

The narrator describes a separation between what man _is_ and what man _does_. The
attitude of rushing through a task shows how much one doesn't care about the task
at hand, but rather is focused getting it done in order to move on to the next thing.

A worker with a "forced mechanized existence" is someone who has little say in the
work that they do; they are commanded, similar to a robot. Similarly, they are
optimized to simply finish the work, not overachieve. I've heard it a few times
from people that they "put in their time" and just work for the money. While I
truly enjoy reading about and working on little personal projects outside of work,
I believe that it's absolutely fine that one doesn't work on work-related tasks
in personal time, I think there is an important distinction about one's attitude
while doing the work _at work_. I believe you can be passionate about something
and deliberately restrain yourself from overworking as to reserve energy and enthusiasm
i.e., avoid burnout.

"Caring" is self-identifying with what it is that one's doing. "When one has this feeling,
then [they] also [see] the inverse side of caring, Quality itself" a "material reflection
of a spiritual reality".

> The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands,
and then work outward from there.

I am extremely grateful and fortunate to be where I am today. I was curious about what the
contributing factors were in the job offer for my current position, so I asked
my colleague and manager. Both replied similarly, that it was my positive attitude,
optimistic view and general enthusiasm for the work. I say this not to boast, but
to help others who are curious about what is important. Sure, expertise is important.
But expertise with the wrong attitude is extremely harmful to a team. This is why
a lot of companies avoid hiring "brilliant jerks".

Related to optimism and positivity, in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,
the narrator says, "If someone's ungrateful and you tell him he's ungrateful, okay,
you've called him a name. You haven't solved anything."

In software engineering,
developers are often introduced to codebase that has existed for a while,
doesn't follow best practices or language idioms and has lots of "warts". In these
situations, developers often immediately start pointing out the warts and potential
points of failure. While it can absolutely be helpful to have a new perspective
to the project, "name calling" doesn't solve anything.

In the situations, if you dig just below the surface --- namely, use what
[Shane Perrish writes about, called Second Order Thinking](https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/) ---
there are usually reasons these warts exist --- whether they developed over time or were added deliberately --- and haven't
been fixed. Either because it is necessary that the warts remain or because the effort
involved in removing them could be better used elsewhere. Related specifically to
deliberately added warts, the narrator tells a story about a beer can shim to
fix loose handlebars. However, the beer can shim was being proposed to be added
to his friend's, "fancy", BMW bike. While functionally, the beer can shim was
perfect, the fact that a literal piece of trash was being proposed as the fix
offended the friend tremendously. The friend decided that he would rather deal
with loose handlebars than to have a "hacky", piece of trash fix his technological
marvel of a bike.

While it is important to evaluate "hacks", avoiding them altogether without acknowledging
them isn't the best approach. If the hack has been evaluated, doesn't have long-term
negative impacts and is able to be removed with a "real" solution, often these hacks
are what allow us to incrementally improve our situations, "tightening of the handlebars".
This is an important lesson in the distinction between underlying form and immediate appearance
that the narrator talks about throughout Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.

## Ego

"Ego goals" and "ego climbing" (p212)

> Any effort that has self-glorification as its final endpoint is bound to end in disaster.

## Classical Versus Romantic Thinking

> [...] all understanding is in terms of underlying form.

Underlying form is the connectedness of functional components. The What, How, Where and Why.
The blueprints of how things _actually_ work and their functional composition.

> You discuss things in terms of their immediate appearance or you discuss things
in terms of their underlying form [...]

The narrator in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance attaches names, specifically,
"classical" and "romantic", to the underlying form and immediate appearance
ways of thinking, respectively.
Classical or scientific thinking i.e., regarding facts, is to think unemotionally
in terms of underlying form.
While to think based on immediate appearance and feelings is to think romantically
or artistically. He continues throughout the book with this distinction.

> [Classical thinking]'s purpose is not to inspire emotionally, but to bring order
out of chaos and make the unknown known.

> Persons tend to think and feel exclusively in one mode or the other and in doing
so tend to misunderstand and underestimate what the other mode is all about.

There is power in understanding the time, place and importance of either mode of
thinking. Not that one is _always_ and exclusively better than the other. However,
people become obsessed with their mode of thinking and neglect to acknowledge the
importance of the other.

With classical thinking, once you intensely analyze or "cut up" --- the narrator often uses
this analogy of dissecting something with a proverbial knife --- and understand something,
the beauty of it is gone. It is no longer mysterious or "magical". It's just pieces
that are put together at many levels. The narrator talks about how you can indefinitely
cut something up, but when you do this, you "kill" it. Romantic thinkers stop before
they've kill the thing and therefore, the magic and beauty still exist and inspire.
This process of cutting something up is a "death-birth continuity". Something new
is "birthed" and killed at each level. In software engineering, you hear the phrase
"yak shaving", which is when you are working on a project and you discover that
in order to complete the task, you have to solve some problem, and in order to solve
that problem, you have to solve some other problem and so on.

### Classical Thinking Challenges

In Chapter 9, the narrator talk about the application of the scientific method,
which [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method),
is "an empirical method of acquiring knowledge." The scientific method is a continuous
process which involves applied skepticism, assumptions or hypotheses and recorded observations.
The narrator talks about how the scientific method is useful for finding "answers"
in levels of underlying form, but doesn't work as well against scientific truths.
With scientific truths, once proved "true", they only remain fully true while they
are not under continued investigation or skepticism, proving them still true or disproving them.

> [...] time spans of scientific truths are an inverse function of the intensity
of scientific effort.

As you continue to investigate a scientific truth, you are _never_ getting any closer
to an answer, only opening significantly more question and potential paths than
can be thoroughly evaluated.

> The more you look, the more you see. Instead of selecting one truth from a multitude
you are _increasing the multitude_ [...].

This means that as you try to move toward an unchanging truth through the application
of the scientific method, you don't move toward it, but rather move _away_ from it
as the multitude of unanswered questions increases.

> The combinations so obtained would be exceedingly numerous, useless and cumbersome.
The true work of the inventor consists in choosing among these combinations so as to
eliminate the useless ones, or rather, to avoid the trouble of making them, and the rules
that must guide the choice are extremely fine and delicate.

When presented with infinitely many choices to choose from, Quality --- keeping in mind
that Quality is based on past experiences --- is what helps us decide which paths to
pursue.

> The difference between a good mechanic and a bad one [...] is precisely this ability to
_select_ the good facts from the bad ones on the basis of quality. He has to _care_!

The narrator, referencing an alternative life of his, namely Phaedrus, said, that
this continual process of opening new questions is a "genetic defect within the
nature of reason itself [...]".

The narrator argues that it is this characteristic of classical thinking that
continues to increase the divide between classical and romantic thinkers. Romantic
thinkers continue to move further away, while classical thinkers go infinitely
_deeper_ in it.

## The Journey

> Sometimes it's a little better to travel than to arrive.

A few times in the book, as the narrator is driving on a less-frequently-traveled
road adjacent to the highway, he talks about the lifeless-looking faces of the
passengers in cars. These passengers have elected to optimize travel as to make
it as short as possible. However, it is during the struggles of "travel" that we
truly learn. In the classical thinking journey of diving deeper is when you are
learning about the intricacies at many levels. If you optimize this travel away
by just obtaining the answer, you won't truly appreciate the fact. Throughout the
book, the narrator is on a journey to define Quality. Quality is something

When you are rushing and don't stop to think, it usually takes longer or comes out worse.

> The reality of your own nature should determine speed. If you become restless, speed up.
If you become winded, slow down. You climb the mountain in equilibrium between
restlessness and exhaustion.

A continuation of the quote above,

> Then, when you're no longer thinking ahead, each footstep isn't just a means to
and end but a unique event in itself [...]. To live only for some future goal is
shallow. It's the side of the mountain which sustain life, not the top.

## Reason and Rationality

The narrator talks about how while reason and rationality progressed humanity significantly
from primitive times, as we continue to dive deeper into topics, it is reason and
rationality that slows us down.

> [...] the harder you think in this high country of the mind the slower you go.

## A Priori Knowledge

> Since all knowledge comes from sensory impressions and since there's no sensory
impression of substance itself, it follows logically that there is no knowledge of substance.
It's just something we imagine. It's entirely within our own minds.

> [...] From what sense data is our knowledge of causation received? In other words,
what is the scientific empirical basis of causation itself? [...] Hume's answer is 'None' [...]
it's just something we imagine when one thing repeatedly follows another [...] then
one must logically conclude that both 'Nature' and 'Nature's Laws' are creations
of our own imagination.

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a priori is defined as "deductive" or "relating to or
derived by reasoning from self-evident propositions".
The author talks about a priori knowledge and how while knowledge _begins_ with experience,
it doesn't _always_ necessarily come from experience. Basically, some experience triggers
a thought, but then without additional experiences triggering additional thoughts, we
think on our own.

> This a priori motorcycle has been built up in our minds over many years from enormous
amount of sense data and it is constantly changing as new sense data comes in.

We are basically continually creating, working on and tweaking our mental models of
our surroundings. While everyone's mental model of some object may differ slightly
based on personal experiences, I think generally our mental models are similar
or evolve to be similar. For example, if one experienced cars in the 1950's one
still has that knowledge and experience, but it is less fresh than the experiences
of today's cars. The data of today's cars is what is used by those experiencing
cars for the first time now in building their mental models. Mental model evolve and
generally converge.

Mental models are continuously evolving, rather than built and fixed. The narrator
talks about how we are always testing and "screening" our mental models.

While new experiences bring inspiration, they also bring bounds to our imagination.
The way one experienced something may differ from the way someone else experienced
the same exact thing and therefore, both individuals have slightly differing
mental models of the same object. These diverse experiences and mental models,
used _collectively_, help us continue to expand our personal and future persons'
mental models.

> "[R]oot expansions of thought" are lateral moves that we "drift" toward that
help us deal with new, possibly unrelated, problems.

> [...] most people stand in sight of the spiritual mountains all their lives and
never enter them, being content to list to other who have been there and thus avoid
the hardships. Some travel into the mountains accompanied by experienced guides who
know the best and least dangerous routes by which they arrive at their destination.
Still others, inexperienced and untrusting, attempt to make their own routes.

> The early climbers established paths that were on firm ground with an accessibility
that appealed to all, but today, the Western routes are all but closed because of
dogmatic inflexibility in the face of change.

A mentor of mine jokes about the "dogmatic inflexibility" of programming language
communities and how it creates barriers to entry for newcomers, but also shifts
focus from solving problems to solving dogmatisms.

## Paralyzing Thought

This is something that I often struggle with. Both when there are too many things
to do, but also when I don't know what I should be doing. The quote "start with the top-left brick"
from Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and [Dr. Richard Hamming's talk "You and Your Research" given at Bell Communications Research Colloquium Seminar on March 7th 1986](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)
have been influential in reminding me to pause and focus on digestible subproblems
(i.e., "divide and conquer" over a lifetime).

From "Your and Your Research",

> [...] plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow.

> [...] solid work, steadily applied, gets you surprisingly far.

Our minds are often paralyzed by trying to repeat and imitate the thoughts and ideas of those
before or surrounding us, rather than truly new and unique thought.

There is a story told by the narrator in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
about a past student of his who was instructed to write a five-thousand word essay
about the front of the Opera House on the main street of Bozeman, Montana. This task
along with having students write about the back of one of their thumbs was to teach
them to think on their own and to not always rely on those before or around them.
People, companies and institutions, often immediately try to find answers to their
problems by copying those around them. This makes me think of how companies cloned
[the Spotify organizational model](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/)
and many later found that it needed to be tweaked for their organization.

As with many things in life, I think there is a pendulum that needs to be in
equilibrium. We can't entirely neglect the experiences of those before or
around us, but we also need to bring our own unique and new ideas to the
proverbial table.

I subscribe to the [30x40 Design Workshop YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/30by40),
where the creator calmly walks you through the architectural process. One quote
that he said that stuck with me is that one of the most important components of
teaching someone how to draw architectural diagrams is to teach them how to see
for themselves.

When you see for yourself, your attitude toward a particular topic changes. You
feel connected and empowered. Conversely, when you are not allowed to see for
yourself because you are told exactly what to do and how to do it, you posses
a negative attitude toward whatever it is that you are doing.

The narrator also talks about this dilemma between grading students' work being
being a clear indicator of direction but also paralyzing unique thought.
Students are conditioned to do what gives them a good grade, not to challenge
what it is that they are asked to do or to think on their own.

When we are "taught" what to do, we lose the "beginner's mind". We are being filled
with the "answers" of those who have experienced the thing. This is both good
and bad because we may avoid going down some "wrong" paths, but maybe those
"wrong" paths are ultimately what push reality forward on a given problem.

> Stuckness shouldn't be avoided. It's the psychic predecessor of all real understanding.

To continue this quote,

> An egoless acceptance of stuckness is a key to an understanding of all Quality,
in mechanical work as in other endeavors. It's this understanding of Quality as
revealed by stuckness which so often makes self-taught mechanics so superior to
institute-trained men who have learned how to handle everything except a new situation.

It is in times of stuckness that we begin to unleash our beginners mind and
fearlessly take "wrong" or original paths.

> [...] stuckness is gradually eliminating patterns of traditional reason.

## Persistent Gumption

> If you're going to repair a motorcycle, an adequate supply of gumption is the first
and most important tool. If you haven't got that you might as well gather up
all the other tools and put them away, because they won't do you any good.

The narrator describes "gumption traps" which are low-quality things that
one encounters while working through a problem that drain gumption and leave
one feeling exhausted and discouraged. There are both internal and external
gumption traps. A common problem that one faces when dealing with or
overcoming a gumption trap is what the narrator calls "gumption desperation",
which is when on tries to rush to "catch back up" in an attempt to restore gumption
after being set back by a gumption trap. But gumption desperation only leads to
more problems, so avoid it.

Remember that having to take something apart and put it back together a few
times isn't a setback if knowledge is gained in the process that will help
in the future.

### Internal Gumption Traps

* "value traps" - blocks of affective understanding
* "truth traps" - blocks of cognitive understanding
* "muscle traps" - blocks of psychomotor behavior

#### Value traps

"Value traps are by far the largest and the most dangerous group". Of these,
"value rigidity" --- or "being stuck in your ways" and being unable to revalue due to
commitments to previous values --- is the most prevalent and pernicious. To avoid
value rigidity, always be aware of your ability to revalue. He says to have
"value fluidity".

> [...] recognize a value trap when you're in it and work on that _before_ you
continue on the machine.

The narrator talks about how we come to posses rigid values because we don't
have the cognitive capacity to hold all possible truths and it's just easier to
be rigid in our ways.

When you are dealing with value rigidity, slow down, step back and just watch the
machine like you would a fishing line.

"Ego gumption" is another trap that the narrator introduces that he says isn't
entirely separate from value rigidity. Ego gumption is when you have a high evaluation
of yourself and your ability to recognize new facts is weakened. "Your ego isolated
you from Quality reality".

> These false [personality] images are deflated so rapidly and completely you're bound
to be very discouraged very soon if you've derived your gumption from ego rather
than Quality.

He suggests that if modesty isn't easy for you, keep faking modesty until the facts
continuously prove that you were wrong.

A couple more internal gumption traps are mentioned in the "anxiety" and "boredom" traps.
With the anxiety trap, you are so afraid to fail and ruin your ego, that you never
take risks. The boredom trap is as the name suggests, you or your mind is bored or burned
out of the problem that you are working on and therefore don't think of new avenues to pursue.
Impatience is also mentioned as related to internal gumption traps.

> Impatience [...] always results from one cause: an underestimation of the amount of time
the job will take.

#### Truth traps

Truth traps are bounded questions with unbounded "mu" answers. The mu answer is not valueless,
but rather indicates that the context of the question is too small for nature's answer and
therefore, "beyond the hypothesis".

> A very strong case can be made for the statement that science grows by it mu answers
more than by its yes or no answers.

Yes or no answers confirm or deny a hypotheses and therefore, stop the process of understanding.
Mu answers allow the process to continue.

#### Psychomotor traps

 Psychomotor traps are basically inadequate tooling and bad surroundings.

#### The biggest gumption trap

The biggest gumption trap of all is the lifeless, emotionless, "funeral procession" way of
living, where you are marching to your funeral. Focused on what comes next rather than
what is around you currently.

> It's paradoxical that where people are the most closely crowded [...] loneliness is the
greatest [...]. Physical distance between people has nothing to do with loneliness. It's
psychic distance [...]

> [...] in this primary America [people] seem to go through huge portions of their lives
without much consciousness of what's immediately around them. The media have convinced
them that what's right around them is unimportant.
