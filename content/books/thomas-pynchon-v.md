Hmm, so this would be a hard one to recommend. It's longer (500+ pages) and there
really isn't a flow or real "story" to the book. There are a couple decent themes.

Honestly, the only reason I didn't drop this book was because it was the only one
I took with me on a beach vacation and I love reading physical books on the beach
and there wasn't a used bookstore in walking distance.


## General Takeaway
This book is one that I probably wouldn't recommend or even read again. I missed comprehending so much of this book. 

I think the main theme of this book is that "love is the journey, not the destination" and that you should do the journey for yourself, no one else. This definitely isn't clear. I think you read this are constantly like "what does this little story have anything to do with the main point?".
