Hmm, so this would be a hard one to recommend. It's longer (500+ pages) and there
really isn't a flow or real "story" to the book. There are a couple decent themes.

Honestly, the only reason I didn't drop this book was because it was the only one
I took with me on a beach vacation and I love reading physical books on the beach
and there wasn't a used bookstore in walking distance.
