p15 - Let us likewise beware of believing the universe is a machine; it is certainly not constructed so as to perform some operation ... The total nature
of the world is, on the other hand, to all eternity chaos

we humanize our universe to belive that "God" is human-like

p16 - Let us beware of saying that death is the opposite of life. The living being is only a species of the dead, and a very rare species...

p16 - he had to be his own commentator and critic. ... You will often hear not one voice but two

p17 - they had flown as far as on _could_ fly! All our great teachers and predecessors have at last come to a stop...; it will be the same with you and me! ... _Other birds will fly further!_

p18 - the secret of realizing the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment of existence is: to _live dangerously_! Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvious! Send your ships out into unchartted seas! Live in conflict with your equals and with yourselves!

p19 - resist any kind of ultimate peace

p21 - I don't want to be lonely any more; I want to learn to be human again.

p23 - The Superman is the meaning of earth.

p24 - I shall return eternally to this identical and self-same life ... to teach once more the eternal recurrence of all things

p25 - _For all joy wants --- eternity!_ ... self-overcoming ... What is truth? ... Isn't it the discovery that no truth is discoverable except the truth which _you yourself are?_ that there is no truth (sense, meaning) in the world except the truth (sense, meaning) _you yourself give it?_ ... To give life meaning:
that has been the grand endeavour of all who have preached 'truth' ... it is something you _create_

p26 - truth is this fortress ... truth is will to power ... two primitive drives emerged as dominant: the desire for power and the emotion of fear.
And when Nietzsche came to understand fear as _the feeling of the absence of power_, he was left with a single
motivating principle for all human actions: the will to power.

p27 - to master _oneself_ is the hardest of all tasks ... a continual self-overcoming of life

p39 - I am weary of my wisdom

p41 - And what does the saint do in the forest? ... _God is dead!_ ... I _teach you the Superman_. Man is something that should be overcome. All creatures hitherto have created something beyond themselves.

p42 - The Superman is the meaning of the earth. ... _remain true to the earth_, and do not believe those who speak to you of superterrestrial hopes!

p44 - I love him who lives for knowledge ... And thus he wills his own downfall ... I love him who justifies the men of the future and redeems the men of the past: for he wants to perish by the men of the present.

p46 - They still work, for work is entertainment. But they take care the entertainment does not exhaust them.

p48 - there is no Devil and no Hell. Your soul will be dead even before your body: therefore fear nothing any more!

p51 - Whom do they hate most? Him who smashes their tables of values

p52 - An eagle ... from it was hanging a serpent, not like prey but like a friend: for it was coiled around the eagle's neck

p54 - the spirit shall become a camel, and the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child. ... becomes a lion; it wants to capture freedom ... to its ultimate God, it will struggle for victory with the great dragon ... The great dragon is call 'Thou shalt'

p55 - the child is innocence and forgetfulness, a new beginning

p56 - Honour to sleep and modesty before it! ... avoid all those who sleep badly and are awake at night! ... You must discover ten truths a day: otherwise you will seek truth in the night too, with your soul still hungry. You must laugh and be cheerful ten times a day: or your stomach, that father of affliction, will disturb you in the night. ... one sleeps badly without a good name

p60 - No longer to bury the head in the sand of heavenly things, but to carry it freely, an earthly head which creates meaning for the earth!

p62 - The Self is always listening and seeking ... It rules and is also the Ego's ruler. Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, stands a mighty commander, an unknown sage --- he is called Self.

p64 - My brother, are war and battle evil? But this evil is necessary, envy and mistrust and calumny among your virtues is necessary

p68 - You tell me: 'Life is hard to bear.' But if it were otherwise why should you have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening?

p69 - The more it wants to rise into the heights and the light, the more determinedly do its roots strive earthwards, downwards, into the darkness, into the depths --- into evil.

p70 - What do I want in the heights? ... the higher I climb, the more do I despise him who climbs. What do I want in the heights? ... I desired my destruction when I wanted to ascend into the heights, and you are the lightning for which I have been waiting!

p72 - Let them be lured by 'eternal life' out of this life!

p72 - 'Life is only suffering' ... _you_ cease to live!

p74 - I see many soldiers: if only I could see many warriors! What they wear is called uniform: may what they conceal with it not be uniform too! ... May your work be a battle, may your peace be a victory!

p74 - it is the good war that hallows every cause. War and courage have done more great things than charity. Not your pity but your bravery have saved the unfortunate up to now. 'What is good?' you ask. To be brave is good.

p75 - Let your love towards life be love towards your highest hope: and let your highest hope be the highest idea of life! ... Man is something that should be overcome. Thus live your life of obedience and war! What good is long life? What warrior wants to be spared?

p75 - The state is the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly it lies, too; and this lie creeps from its mouth: 'I, the state, am the people.'

<mark>
p77 - They devour one another and cannot even digest themselves. ... Often filth sits upon the throne --- and often the throne upon filth, too.
</mark>

p77 - all these idolators ... Leave the idolatry of the superfluous!

p78 - Flee, my friend, into your solitude! ... Where solitude ceases, there the market-place begins

p83 - In your friend you should possess your best enemy. Your heart should feel closest to him when you oppose him.

p84 - Much that seemed good to one people seemed shame and disgrace to another: thus I found.

p84 - What it accounts hard it calls praiseworthy; what it accounts indispensable and hard it call good; and that which relieves the greatest need, the rare, the hardest of all --- it glorifies as holy.

p87 - Higher than love of one's neighbour stands love of the most distant man and of the man of the future ... One man runs to his neighbour because he is looking for himself

p90 - You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame

p94 - It is more noble to declare yourself wrong than to maintain you are right, especially when you _are_ right. Only you must be rich enough for it.

p99 - In your death, your spirit and your virtue should still glow ... otherwise yours is a bad death.

p103 - The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends.

p111 - All _feeling_ suffers in me and is in prison: but my _willing_ always comes to me as my liberator and bringer of joy. Willing liberates

p111 - for what would there be to create if gods --- existed!

p113 - Be reserved in accepting! Honour a man by accepting from him!

p123 - be freed from the bonds of revenge ... Mistrust all in whom the urge to punish is strong!

p127 - for where there are oases there are also idols.

p137 - he who cannot obey himself will be commanded ... commanding is more difficult than obeying ... In all commanding there appeared to me to be an experiment and a risk: and the living creature always risks himself when he commands.

p145 - gaze at life without desire and not, as a dog does, with tongue hanging out ... be happy in gazing ... without the grasping and greed of egoism

p159 - If one takes the hump away from the hunchback, one takes away his spirit

p160 - men who lack everything except one thing, of which they have too much --- men who are no more than a great eye or a great mouth or a great belly or something else great --- I call such men inverse cripples.

p161 - The will cannot will backwards

p162 - The will is a creator

p168 - My words have yet moved no mountains and what I have spoken has not reached men. ... How do you know _that_?

p168 - Thoughts that come on doves' feet guide the world. ... You must yet become a child and without shame.

p182 - a living lighthouse of unconquerable life.

p198 - Where one can no longer love, one should --- _pass by_!

p202 - you were _lonelier_ among the crowd, you solitary ... Loneliness is one thing, solitude another

p204 - there is too much foreground in all men ... Especially those who call themselves 'the good' did I discover to be the most poisoness flies

p206 - the three most-cursed things: Sensual pleasure, lust for power, selfishness

p208 - Lust for power: before its glance man crawls and bends and toils and becomes lower than the swine or the snake

p213 - not good taste, not bad taste, but _my_ taste ... Thus I answered those who asked me 'the way'. For _the_ way --- does not exist!

p215 - man is a bridge and not a goal

p217 - We all bleed at secret sacrificial tables

p219 - Where have there ever been better thieves and killers in the world than such holy words have been?

p220 - there are gods but no God!

p222 - there is much wisdom in the fact that there is much filth in the world ... Let the world be! Do not raise even a finger against it!

p223 - Wisdom makes weary, nothing is worth while; you shall not desire! ... Nothing is worth while! You shall not will!

p226 - there is often more bravery in containing oneself and passing by: _in order_ to spare onself for a worthier enemy! ... you must be proud of your enemy

p226 - Keep your eyes clear of their For and Against!

p228 - I have always found the badly-paired to be the most revengeful ... may the garden of marriage assist you

p230 - For the good -- _cannot_ create: they are always the beginning of the end: -- they crucify him who writes new values on new law-tables, they sacrifice the future _to themselves_
