It took me a while to enjoy this book. There were only a few of the short stories
that I actually enjoyed and it took me until the last 10 pages or so to really
enjoy the novella, Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way.

## Little Expressionless Animals

- "animals faces have no expression... A man's face has nothing on it." [p 41]

## Girl With Curious Hair

- "... how glad I was that I had gotten to be friends with such find and fun persons!
They are very unique and different from my past friends whom I had growing up in
Alexandria, Virginia and attending fine schools and universities such as the Westminster
Military Academy, Brown University, the Wharton School of Business at the University
of Pennsylvania, and the Law School at the University at Yale. All my past friends
have real names and wear clothes similar to mine." [p 60]
- "Los Angeles Young Republicans" [p 61]
- "serving as the carrier of the Black Boc of nuclear codes for the President" [p 62]
- "my white experiencs and emotions" [p 67]
- "I was a Sick Puppy who already had everything, thus he wished to inquire as to
why I traded my big everything for a big nothing." [p 68]
- "I claimed that that was a riot of amusement: a punkrocker with ammunition such
as Cheese being freightened of a dapper and handsome civilian like Sick Puppy" [p 70]

## Here and There

- "reader, as well as object?" [p 153]
- "Words as fulfillers of the function of signification in artistic communication
will wither like the rules of form before them. Meaning will be clean..." [p 155]
- "Then say that art necessarily exists in a state of tension with its own standards." [p 155]
- "... becomes another here instead of a there." [p 164]
- "... think about how _boring_ it would be to be perfect." [p 166]

## My Appearance

- sell out
- "I didn't want to be made to look as though I'd prostituted my name and face
and talents to a meat company." [p 183]
- Commercials of the parodies of the commercials

## Say Never

- "I will wait for something to wait for." [p 224]
- Face it; don't avoid it indefinitely.

## Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way

- "Look-Mom-no-hands quality" [p 234]
- "those painfully radiant types whose apparent blindness to their own radiance
only makes the sting of the light meaner." [p 235]
- **"Admen do this. Bet their life on criticism, attention, desire, fear, love, marriage
of concession and market. Retention of image. Loyalty to brand. Empathy with client.
Sales. On life. _Life_."** [p 240]
- "Does a Funhouse need to be more than Fun?" [p 242]
- "Central Illinois is, by no imaginer's stretch, a Funhouse" [p 242]
- "in about the 1960's, is that they tend to live too intensely inside their own
social moment, and thus tend to see all existence past age thirty or so as somehow
postcoital." [p 264]
- "no-handsism", "metafiction" [p 265]
- "Reunion to end all reunions." [p 267]
- "the preceding generation of crippingly self-conscious writers, obsessed with
their own interpretation" [p 269]
- "We just want to do the bare unavoidable minimum. Pay taxes, die." [p 269]
- "anybody who'll take money from a stranger, in an airport, for free, with no
idea of who we are or what if any scam is at work, who'll reveal his number-one
fear and desire to a clipboard, for money, is a born consumer" [p 284]
- "This is the main, this is the legendary man, I'm sure you two know, who eventually
got Arm and Hammer baking soda customers to start _pouring the stuff down the drain_.
As ... get this ... _drain freshener_!" [p 285]
- "_Drain_ odor?...It's just fear." [p 285]
- "your arrow, at full draw, is somewhere between three and nine centimeters to
the left of the true straight line to the bull's-eye" [p 293]
- "The car itself looked like a car for neither adults nor children. It was a huge,
ageless, jacked-up, malevolent sports car" [p 297]
- "I built this baby from scratch. It's not technically an anything. It's a me if
it's anything." [p 298]
- "TV about bodies politic and people with dying bodies or robbers and cops puncturing
bodies or doctors resealing bodies. **Novels about novelists writing novels about
novelists**, who never succumb." [p 309]
- "Advertising will have finally arrived at the death that's been its object all
along. And in Death, it will of course become Life." [p 310]
- "Credit cards aren't toys." [p 315]
- "Credit is _political_... It's a tool of the elite. You use credit without thinking,
you're unthinkingly endorsing a status quo." [p 316]
- "Politics is everywhere. Except thank God in stuff like popular culture. That's
why entertainment's so important... It is pretty much the only escape." [p 317]
- "Pure entertainment" [p 317]
- "**Especially in reruns...Incredibly comforting. You know just how the universe
is going to be for the next hour. Totally secure. Detached but connected. A womb
with a view.**" [p 317]
- You're paying to go to school to write and you don't write anything? ... I'm not
terribly prolific... These things happen in programs. That's why I've decided I
detest all... You're blocked? ... Probably a standards problem... I get a creative
type under me who's blocked, it always in the end turns out to be just a problem
of unrealistic standards." [p 327]
- "That art-school crap's bogus, man... **Only bullshit artists move in packs.**" [p 327]
- Stories are like marriages. "A story ought to lead you to bed with both hands." [p 330]
- "Ambrose's famous metafictional story, 'Lost in the Funhouse'" [p 331]
- "Mark has always been so troubled by the story, and by Ambrose's willingness
now to franchise his art into a new third dimension --- to build 'real' Funhouses." [p 331]
  - sell out
- "_backwards_: they want to build a Funhouse for lovers out of a story that does
not love." [p 331]
- "A story, just maybe, should treat the reader like it wants to... well, fuck him." [p 331]
- "'selling out; is fundamentally redundant." [p 333]
- "You think an ad's just a piece of art?... You think it's not about what life's
really about? That your fear and desires grow on trees? Come out of nowhere?" [p 338]
- "**dividing this fiction business into realistic and naturalistic and surrealistic
and modern and postmodern and new-realistic and meta- is like dividing history into
cosmic and tragic and prophetic and apocalyptic; is like dividing human beings into
white and black and brown and yellow and orange. It atomizes, does not bind crowds,
and, like everything timelessly dumb, leads to blind hatred, blind loyalty, blind
supplication.**" [p 346]
- "if you're going to classify everything, you might at least divide by the knife
of what is desired. of _where_ in the sky to look for the nothing-new sun. Divide
from inside. Homiletic fiction desires peace. Eleemosynary fiction desires charity.
Iconodulistic fiction desires order. Prurient fiction desires desire. Apocalyptic
fiction desires the invevitable change it hides behind fearing." [p 347]
- "What you're scared of has always been what moved you." [p 349]
- "**That what unlocks you, event today, is what you _want_ to want. In what you value.
And what you value's married to those certain things you _just won't do_... whether
you're free or locked up depends, all and only, on what you want. What you have matters
about as much as the color of your sky. Or your bars.**" [p 349]
- "we _already_ ache with desire for what we fear." [p 349]
- "Everybody who really wants to knows what's true. Most people just don't want
to. It means listening from deep inside. Most people just don't want to." [p 351]
- Listen to _you_. The _you_ _you_ want to be.
- "alone fun" [p 354]
- Life in prison for counterfeiting. Symbolizing the trap of not thinking for yourself. [p 364]
- "Don't all, facing Life, given the chance, flee?" [p 365]
- "I will not rat. And you cannot make me. I've got Life, coming." [p 365]
- "**The adult world, in Dave's opinion, has turned out to be a basically shifty,
shitty place. It's risky and often sad and always wildly _insecure_. It beats him
over the head... He knows, now, that nearly everything you call Yours in this world
can be taken away from you by other people, assuming they want it enough....They
can't take your honor. Only that can be given.**" [p 368-369]
- Life is the Funhouse.
