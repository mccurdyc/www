subtitle: "A Journey to the Center of the Internet"
description: "While many people view the Internet as a bubble of omnipresent connectivity, the core of the Internet is localized to relatively few places, like Ashburn, Virginia or 60 Hudson Street in New York City. This book takes a journey to these few places that are the core to the foundation of the Internet."
