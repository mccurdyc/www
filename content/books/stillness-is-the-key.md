I honestly thought this book was going to be one of those self-help books that was full of "fluff" and kept repeating the same message, but I was pleasantly surprised and did enjoy this book. There were a lot of useful, blunt and well-researched anecdotes.

Grant's answer was simple: "I am solving the problem of poverty." ... Why hate himself for working for a living? What was shameful about that?
