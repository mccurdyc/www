> Managing teams is a series of complex black boxes interacting with other complex black boxes. -@skamille

This post is not a comprehensive review or summary of The Manager's Path, but rather
my interpretation of the key takeaways for me _at this point_ (two-years in) in my career
as a software engineer at a hyper-growth company. As I've said before, I read a lot
of management books (e.g., [The Hard Things About Hard Things]({{< ref "/books/hard-things-about-hard-things.md" >}}),
[An Elegant Puzzle]({{< ref "/books/elegant-puzzle.md" >}}), etc.)
to both help me understand the perspective of and navigate situations with my manager
and skip-level management.

My interest in reading more about engineering management
was sparked when a great manager of mine taught me how to influence the change
that I wanted to see in ways other than lobbying. He explained that a foundational
principal of a product-driven technology company is managing the balance between
product and engineering-focused work.

## Influencing Change

> The only person that you can change is yourself. -@skamille

Often what you will have to do is motivate technical changes through value added
to the product (e.g., performance, reliability, reduced on-boarding costs, etc.).
In my first year in industry, I would lobby for technical change, which often
resulted in projects never becoming a priority. Instead of lobbying for change,
you should make the change, share with a small group of people, gather feedback,
tweak as you see fit and then iteratively share with larger groups.

Evangelizing your current and completed work is also foundational in your career growth.
The angle at which you evangelize your work should be tailored to your audience.
If the room is full of engineers, you may not need to motivate adding a test suite
and integrating it into the continuous integration (CI) workflow. However,
if you are in a room with the product team, you absolutely need to motivate
these types of changes _from their perspective_ e.g., improved reliability, reduced on-boarding
costs of new engineers to the project, faster feature cycles. Otherwise, to product,
the equivalent time spent adding the test suite and integrating into CI could
have been spent elsewhere.

## Understanding the _Why_

Understanding _why_ you are doing something will help improve your mental health. If
you know you are working on something important and of value to the company, you
will probably be happier than someone who doesn't know why they are doing something.
The responsibility of understanding why you are working on something shouldn't
fall entirely on your manager. You should feel empowered to ask, "why?", if you
don't understand why what you are doing is valuable or valuable _at this point in time_.

You should help others understand why they are working on something if you see
that they are struggling with understanding why.
Evangelizing the work that others are doing while they are working on it is something
that I have tried to do more. When I hear them say, "I didn't do anything important
this sprint", I remind them that they just finished a huge value add. I think the
responsibility of voicing the importance of work falls on team members looking
out for each other and on the engineering manager.

It may be the case that _occasionally_ you have to work on something that you don't
value --- e.g., maybe the hacky system, or the project written in a language that
you despise --- but, your work "needn't always be self-sacrificing."

> [a]utonomy...is an important element of motivation. -@skamille

Honestly, in my experience, people aren't working on what they want because they
haven't expressed their interests or they haven't motivated their interests in a way that
adds immediate value. Often what I will hear is, "I want to rewrite this system
because it's poorly written." Even if every single new feature in this system takes a
week to add, no matter how trivial, and there is a lot of risk associated with changes,
this might be a price that product is willing to deal with to avoid a multi-month
rewrite. You have to break these large changes down into "bite-size" or sprint-size
pieces, which will help the change seem more achievable. The product team is driven
by completion. Additionally, if you are
able to break these pieces down and have them align with the product roadmap, you
will have a higher chance of them being prioritized.

## Expectations of a Manager

In my experience, defining and upholding expectations is a core function of being
a software engineer. From engineering career ladder level setting to task estimation.
Similarly, there are things that you can and should expect from a "good" manager,
such as _frequent_ and "productive" one-on-one meetings (1:1s), rapid feedback (especially things that
are not going well, but also praise) and finally, action i.e., the manager listens
to what you are saying and actually addresses the problems. Fournier starts the
book with a section titled, "What to Expect from a Manager", where she mentions
that there are engineers who have never had a "good" manager. Either their manager took
the approach of "benign neglect" and held infrequent 1:1s or they were actively
abusive and only held 1:1s to yell at them.

### One-on-One Meetings (1:1s)

In my experience, surprisingly, many engineers prefer benign neglect over the frequent 1:1s.
I, on the other hand, especially being remote, prefer weekly 1:1s with my direct
manager and less frequent
1:1s with skip-level managers and peers. I've scheduled the bi-weekly 1:1s with
skip-levels and peers such that each week is evenly distributed with meetings rather
than one week being "bloated" with meetings and the next being "light".

> Knowing yourself is step one. Step two is going after what you want. -@skamille

These 1:1s are in addition to daily stand-ups. I've heard some engineers try to argue
that stand-ups are an adequate replacement for 1:1s. Fournier talks about this too,
but 1:1s should not just be time for project status updates, especially at the
individual contributor level. Instead, 1:1s with direct managers/reports
should be a place where you talk about personal issues or things preventing you from being
(or enabling you to be) the best contributor that you can be (e.g., a communication
issue due to poor team structure, etc.). Fournier isn't the only one that has said
that _you_, especially the more senior you are, should be defining the agenda
of 1:1s. If you don't know where to start, I personally suggest starting with the
sprint retrospective format i.e., "What went well", "What didn't go well and how
to improve" and "Action items". Defining the agenda for your 1:1s aligns with the
notion that as you become more senior, you "bring solutions, not problems".

One of the best things that you can do in 1:1s is to listen to what the other person
is saying. Fournier says that, "[l]istening is the first and most basic skill of managing
people." She goes on to say that listening is the "precursor to empathy." In the
episode, [Decoding Difficult Conversations](https://fs.blog/sheila-heen/) of
[The Knowledge Project with Shane Parrish podcast](https://fs.blog/the-knowledge-project/),
guest, NY Times best selling author, Harvard Law School lecturer and negotiation
expert, Sheila Heen, discusses how [listening is an often underutilized and weak
skill for many people](https://overcast.fm/+Ei1CYqoLA/15:10). Both Fournier and
Heen discuss how often people ["pretend" to listen](https://overcast.fm/+Ei1CYqoLA/15:55),
while really they are spending that time thinking about what they are going to say
next.

I am now cognizantly aware of when I am preparing my next statement instead of
actively listening. Something that has helped me actively listen more is having a
shared Google Doc up or some form of note taking so that I can jot my thought
down quickly so that I don't forget it when it is my turn to share. Most of the
time, people won't mind if you do this because conversations should be about sharing
knowledge and if you have something important to the conversation, they wouldn't
want that thought to be lost either. I do let people know when I start taking notes
on video chats or in person that I am taking notes about the conversation and not
doing other work. I mainly do this because it bothers during 1:1 video chats when
I clearly see someone doing something on their computer. My first thought is checking
email or Slack, but if you let people know that you are actually taking notes, I
think it helps avoid the perception that you are doing other work.

Going back to the idea of conversations being a means for sharing knowledge,
Fournier makes a phenomenal point about this notion of the "hive mind" and how
most peoples' (primarily engineers') written and spoken language is often lacking.
When ideas or concerns can't be effectively shared through written or spoken language,
progress isn't made.

## Being Able to Say, "No"

Fournier describes in one of the "Good Manager, Bad Manager" sections the "people pleaser"
and how this individual typically says, "yes" to everything but can't feasibly
act on all of the things they've said yes to. Being able to say, "no" is important
in upholding "agreements". In a recent long car drive, I listened to [episode #60
of the Knowledge Project with Shane Parrish and guest Jim Dethmer](https://fs.blog/jim-dethmer/).
The episode starts with Dethmer stating that most people in organizations
keep between 40 and 60 percent of their agreements. Most of the agreements that
aren't upheld are because agreements are accepted without clear terms.

He does describe the commonality in organizations to expect acceptance or rejection
to an agreement immediately after the agreement has been proposed. Rather than
giving people the opportunity to think
and reflect on whether upholding the agreement is feasible. This is precisely when
you should feel empowered to say "no", using one of the strategies proposed by
Fournier. Your response doesn't have to explicitly be "no". Instead, it could be,
"give me until the end of the day to get you a response" or "yes, but we can't do
this piece in this time frame. Either change the time or we can drop this piece."

Asking for the rest of the day gets you out of the situation of giving a response
with people in the room where you aren't clearly thinking about what all the task
entails. The second makes sure that you are aligning expectations. You display
you understand the importance of doing the task, but you are helping align their
expectations on when and what will be delivered. As a manager, you should make
sure that you are establishing a culture where people shouldn't feel that it is
necessary to give a response immediately after something has been proposed, but
also should be empowering your team to say "no".

> If you were only allowed to work 45 hours this week, what would you do with those
> 45 hours? -@skamille

Fournier makes this point when she is discussing picking your battles. For example,
if you are a senior engineer, is it worth nitpicking every single little detail
in a junior's code? This point is also helpful when deciding what you
are going to say "yes" to. Every task isn't so important that it must be done this
week. When you are saying "yes" to tasks, make sure you are thinking about what
you are saying yes to and make sure that it aligns with your personal roadmap and
the company roadmap. If it doesn't align with either of these, make sure that you
ask why you are doing the task. Could you be working "smarter" instead of working longer?
For example, instead of every week saying yes to manually creating a report, propose
automating the process. Even repetitive easy tasks are a waste of time. Sometimes
it is good to "be lazy" and not put up with repetitive, manual, ["toil"](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/)
tasks forever.
