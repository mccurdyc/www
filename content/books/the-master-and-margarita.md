This was a trip. It was weird. It was fun. I don't know that I would say it was a particularly enjoyable read. It didn't seem to flow.
It reminded me a bit of Pynchon's _Gravity's Rainbow_. That doesn't mean that it wasn't good. Not enjoyable doesn't mean
"bad". It was a completely different fun experience. It stretched the imagination a bit.
