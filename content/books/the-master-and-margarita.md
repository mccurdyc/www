This was a trip. It was weird. It was fun. I don't know that I would say it was a particularly enjoyable read. It didn't seem to flow.
It reminded me a bit of Pynchon's _Gravity's Rainbow_. That doesn't mean that it wasn't good. Not enjoyable doesn't mean
"bad". It was a completely different fun experience. It stretched the imagination a bit.

p8 - "No, we don't believe in God ... The majority of the population consciously and long ago ceased believing
in the fairy tales about God. ... what, then, about the proofs of God's existence, of which known, there are exactly
five? ... if there is no God, then, one may ask, who governs human life and, in general, the whole order of things on earth?
Man governs himself ... how can man govern, if he is not only deprived of the opportunity of making a plan
for at least some ridiculously short period --- well, say, a thousand years --- but cannot even vouch for his own tomorrow?"

p26 - "asked me to give my view of state power. ... I said that all power is violence over people, and that a time
will come when there will be no power of the Caesars, nor any other power. Man will pass into the kingdom
of truth and justice, where generally there will be no need for any power at all."

p30 - Yeshua Ha-Nozri (Jesus) is sentence to death. The power of his preaching is recognized.

p87 - "one word made him jump; it was the word, 'schizophrenia' ... I've been got up as a madman, and nobody wants to listen to me! ... Very
well, sir, I'll check you out of here right now, if you tell me you're normal. Not prove, but merely tell. So, then, are you

in a psychiatric clinic, yet you keep saying he doesn't exist. Really, it's strange!"

p135 - "You're a writer? ... I am a master" The author is the master. But there is fear to say what you truly believe
as an author. The Master burns his novel. "She begged me not to be afraid of anything. ... I struggled with myself like a madman.
I had strength enough to get to the stove and start a fire with in it. ... fear possessed every cell of my body ... Poor woman ...
However, I have hopes that she has forgotten me... But you may recover ... I am incurable"

p175 - Matthew to kill Yeshua to save him from suffering on the cross in the heat. "Yeshua was more fortunate than the other two.
In the very first hour, he began to have blackouts, and then he fell into oblivion, hanging his head in its unwound turban. The flies and horseflies
