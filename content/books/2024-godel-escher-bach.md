P-1 
- "how it is that animate beings can come out of inanimate matter"
- "What is self..."
- "strange loop" notion holds the key to unraveling the mystery that we conscious
beings call "being" or "consciousness".
- "the quintessential strange loop that lies  at the core of the proof of Kurt Godel's
famous incompleteness theorem

p9 - information-preserving transformations. Also called an "isomorphism"
p17 - Godel's incompleteness theorem paraphrase "All consistent axiomatic formulations
of number theory include undecidable propositions."
p53 - "...it is natural to wonder about what portion of reality can be imitated in its
behavior by a set of meaningless symbols governed by formal rules. Can all of reality
be turned into a formal system?"

p82 - "... people often attribute meaning to words in themselves, without being
in the slightest aware of the very complex 'isomorphism' that imbues them with meanings...
It attributes attributes all the meaning to the _object_ (the word), rather than
to the _link_.

p83 levels of meaning / abstractions

p97 levels of formal systems

p110 "meta wishes"
"I wish that I had a HUNDRED wishes, instead of just three! Pretty clever, eg, Mr. T?" - A
"I don't grant meta-wishes" - Genie
"I wish you'd tell me what a 'meta-wish' is!" - A
"Why don't you rephrase your last request" - T
(There are many points in this book where I was triggered to think about "prompt engineering")
"GOD won't permit me to" - G
"This is my meta-lamp"
"I have a special wish to make of you, O Djinn, and of GOD"
"who -- or what -- GOD is?"
"'GOD' is an acronym which stands for 'GOD Over Djinn'. The word 'Djinn' is used
to designate Genies, Meta-Genies, Meta-Meta-Genies, etc. It is a Typeless word."
"...does any djinn ever make a mistake, and garble up a message moving up or down the chain?"
"You see, the chances are infintesimal...but when you put an infinite number...it becomes virtually certain."
"I wish my wish would not be granted!"
"The System crashed... transported to Tumbolia."

p127 "recursion seems to brush paradox very closely"
"Actually, a recursive definition (when properly formulated) never leads to infinite
regress or paradox. This is because a recursive definition never defines something in terms of itself,
but always in terms of _simpler versions_ of itself.

p164 "We do not know enough about the nature of intelligence, emotions, or music
to say whether the inner logic of a piece by Bach is so universally compelling
that its meaning could span galaxies."

p170 The "Jukebox" Theory of Meaning - "no message has intrinsic meaning"

p193 "the outermost system always remains an unproven assumption, accepted on faith."

p194 "Fallacies can result if you fail to distinguish carefully between working
in the system (the M-mode) and thinking about the system (the I-mode)."

p252 "words lead to some truth -- some falsehood... Relying on words to lead you
to the truth is like relying on an incomplete formal system to lead you to the truth...
a formal system -- no matter how powerful -- cannot lead to all truths... what else
is there to rely on, but formal systems?"

p254 "If words are bad, and thinking is bad, what is good?"

p255 Zen and Tumbolia
The Zen monk Bassui wrote a letter to one of his disciples who was about to die,
and in it he said: "Your end which is endless is a snowflake dissolving in the
pure air." The snowflake, which was once very much a discernable subsystem of the universe,
now dissolves into the larger system which once held it. Though it is no longer present
as a distinct subsystem, its essence is somehow still present, and will remain so.
It floats in Tumbolia, along with hiccups that are not being hiccuped and characters
in stories that are not being read... Zen recognizes its own limitations, just as
mathematicians have learned to recognize the limitations of the axiomatic method
as a method for attaining truth. This does not mean that Zen has an answer to what
lies beyond Zen any more than mathematicians have a clear understanding of the forms
of valid reasoning which lies outside of formalization. One of the clearest Zen
statements about the borderlines of Zen is given in the following ...

"You monks should know there is an even higher understanding in Buddhism." "What
is the higher Buddhism?" "It is not Buddha".

There is always further to go; enlightenment is not the end-all of Zen. And there
is no recipe which tells how to transcend Zen; the only thing one can rely on for
sure is that Buddha is _not_ the way. Zen is a system and cannot be its own metasystem;
there is always something outside of Zen, which cannot be fully understood or described
within Zen.
