## Three-sentence Summary

In life, we are just players in many games. We can choose to play these games with
a finite or infinite mindset, where we try to "win" or "achieve" something, or
perpetuate the game, respectively. There are many external, societal pressures
that turn into internal pressures, which encourage finite mindedness; we must
fight these pressures and remember the Cause that we aim to perpetuate.

## Reading Context

Author, Simon Sinek pulls inspiration from a book that I read earlier this
year, titled [_Finite and Infinite Games_]({{<ref "books/finite-and-infinite-games.md">}}), by James P. Carse.
It was while reading Finite and Infinite Games that I ordered this book, The Infinite Game.

## Finite v. Infinite Games

> An infinite game is a game where the game outlives its players. [p.7]

A finite game is any game where "winning" is defined as a set of constraints and
when those constraints are met, the game ends. Infinite games are those where we
play, but the only object of play is to perpetuate the game itself. In infinite
games, because there is --- by definition --- no end to the game, there is no such thing as "winning".
Often, we still approach infinite games --- such as business --- with finite plans
that try to "win" or achieve some arbitrary metrics, which in the long run probably
mean very little. We must remember, the goal of participating in infinite games is to advance and
perpetuate some purpose or Cause.

## Just Cause

Our "Just Cause", as Sinek calls it, "is something bigger than ourselves [p.89].
Something that we can't achieve by ourselves because our lifetime is too short.
We must live our lives thinking generations in the future. How do we inspire and
encourage our children, granchildren and great-grandchildren? It's hard to fathom
thinking this far in advance --- I know I struggle with it --- but with a Cause
or purpose and momentum in the right direction, we are working on something that
will have multi-generational impact.

> No matter how successful we are in life, when we die, none of us will be declared the winner of life... All of these things are journeys, not events. [p.4]

> To live a life with an infinite mindset means thinking about second and third order effects of our decisions [p.223].


A Cause must be specific and visible, but necessarily unobtainable. Sinek called
out "moonshots", saying that these are not Causes, because moonshots are finite
and achievable [p.53]. Similarly, Causes must be meaningful. A goal of "growth"
alone is meaningless [p.59]. "Just like it would affect a human being", Sinek says,
"organizations that eat to get fat will eventually suffer from health problems."

> In an organization that is only driven by the finite, we may _like_ our jobs
some days, but we will likely never _love_ our jobs. If we work for an organization
with a Just Cause, we may like our jobs some days, but we will always love our
jobs [p.33].

Understanding and explicitly defining our personal values is hard and often done
abstractly. I struggle with this personally quite a bit. The abstract nature of
values is probably what makes them easier for us to push to the side when evaluated
against more concrete things such as an explicitly-defined salary, etc. [p.90].

As human, we often think from a finite, concrete perspective --- e.g., winning,
solving, or completing --- because it's easier. In reality, many of the activities
in which we participate are more infinite and therefore, impossible to "win", "solve" or "complete",
but rather only advance or perpetuate.

Viewing infinite activities in terms of finite outcomes is dangerous and exhausting.
I recently read [Shadow Factory]({{< ref "/books/shadow-factory.md">}}), which talked about the goal of "winning" the
war on terrorism. While one could argue that the war on terrorism _could_ be won
by going to some crazy extremes where all data is perfectly monitored, one would probably overlook everything --- including
one's privacy, being able to travel freely, etc. --- that would be sacrificed to achieve this "win".
But is this really a win? When you have nothing left, there is nothing more to lose.

The true value of an organization in the Infinite Game is not determined by arbitrary
metrics, but rather peoples' desire for the organizations Cause to perpetuate. One
way that an organization can ensure that its vision is perpetuated is to focus on
resiliency --- not stability --- to endure unpredictability [p.12].

Think about being in-shape, physically. While you can "achieve" being in-shape,
fundamentally, there has to be a mindset shift that helps you perpetuate it. There's
little value in getting into shape once, only to revert back to being out-of-shape.

Consistency is more important than intensity. Instead, focus on the little things
that you can do to continually make incremental progress and that help perpetuate
the goal of being in shape rather than "achieving" it. It's the same as a business
becoming the best in their field. There is little value in achieving this position,
rather than perpetuating the Cause of the company.

There are other infinite goals that a company must perpetuate internally in order
to effectively be an infinite company, e.g., Trusting Teams [p.118]. Trust is something
that takes a long time to build over numerous events, but can be lost with a single
event. Before one can effectively work toward external goals, one must work on
internal problems. Working on the internal problems may actually result in external
momentum [p.126].

> ... customers will never love a company until employees love the company first ... [p.126]

An internal component that many companies realize is important is culture. While
it's easy to write what you _think_ the culture is or want it to be, that is not
what the culture actually is. The true culture is defined by the reinforced values and
behaviors of the teams, organizations, company and environment [p.121]. There may
be multiple systems at play --- possibly even acting against each other --- that
are reinforcing behaviors. It doesn't
matter what you've written down to define the culture, it's all about what behavior
is made easy and reinforced. Simple things --- maybe even regulatory things --- can
ruin a culture that you've tried to establish.

> In weak culture, people find safety in the rules... They believe a strict adherence to the rules provides them with job security [p.127].

Lazy Leadership putting in place process "solutions" to fix people problems is
what further contributes to weak cultures. Processes are easy to define and roll
out. While process solutions may get you what you want in the short-term, they
rarely solve the deeper cultural issue. They are like cultural bandages.

## Worthy Rivals

> Without a Worthy Rival we risk losing our humility and our agility [p.179].

Worthy Rivals are the other players --- competitor is a finite concept --- with
similar goals in the Infinite Game. In business, this is often another company. In school, it may
be another student, etc.. We must realize that having Worthy Rivals is a good thing;
they are what help us push to be better than we are today, by helping us realize and
strengthen our weaknesses. We must not succumb to finite-minded thought of
"beating" our Worthy Rivals [p.172], but instead think about how to perpetuate our Cause.

## Existential Flexibility

Not to be confused with adaptability or resiliency, Existential Flexibility is
an offensive maneuver seeking to advance the Cause [p.186]. There may come a time
when what you are doing is starting to take a path tangent to the Cause. This path
may still lead to "success" in some regards, but there may be a path that leads to
more success in regard to the Cause. It is at that time that an Existential
Flex --- or leap --- must occur.

Don't confuse Existential Flexibility with "shiny-object syndrome" [p.187], where
you get caught up chasing whatever is new.

Sinek believes that at some point, every organization will need to make an Existential
Flex [p.194]. But whether or not they take it will most likely depend on whether
the leaders are finite or infinite-minded.
Often leaders become obsessed with finite-mindedness and the opportunity to Flex
passes. Leaders allow the forces of the market --- and not personal passion for the
vision --- dictate an organizations future [p.195].

It is precisely these forces of the market or space that we are in that encourage
our finite mindedness [p.199].

## Shareholder Value

Sinek talks about how Milton Friedman's definition of capitalism and views on
the purpose of business being to make money and distributing that wealth to
shareholders has lead to "capitalism abuse" [p.75]. Relatedly, Friedman used the phrase
"ethical customs", which Sinek interpreted as and disagreed with, "what becomes
customary or normal is ethical, until boundaries are defined" [p.77].
