# "ABOUT ME"

## "DIFFERENTIATORS"

My differentiators are my optimisim, kindness, notetaking abilities and willingness
to tackle any problem. I'm careful with my words and very aware of how easy it
is to destroy a relationship that took a while to build. I believe that trusting
relationships are key to success, even with effective processes. Therefore, I
operate with the mindset that relationships are paramount.

## "CAREER"

I joined [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) in March of 2020 as a
Software Engineer on the Data Infrastructure team. The role has primarily consisted
of helping product teams become more operationally independent. I have helped
by building tooling, implementing processes, writing documentation and leading
effective project handoffs.

Previously, I worked at [StockX](https://stockx.com/)
where I designed, implemented and maintained many microservices written in Go.
My primary focus was integrating with Google Shopping, which at the time was
a majority of the company's monthly marketing spend (i.e., millions of dollars).
Integrating with Google Shopping was a particularly challenging problem for StockX
due to the nature of StockX's platform --- i.e., highly fluid pricing.
I built and maintained the Google Shopping pipeline for two years before a team
was established to own the pipeline. I effectively transfered ownership of
the pipeline as I was interested in moving to the DevOps team.

Prior to joining StockX in May of 2017 as employee number 50 --- approximately
the 5th backend engineer --- I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science at
Allegheny College, where my research focus was software testing, specifically
analyzing a technique known as mutation testing for evaluating test suite adequacy.

## "INTERESTS"

Outside of work, my primary interests are traveling, running, reading
and photography. A perfect day for me would look like getting up at 5AM, making
a pour-over coffee while reading a book, going for a 10k run and then finishing
the day off going on a short drive with my wife, Meghan, to photograph Golden hour.

My wife and I started dating in 9th grade in 2010, married in 2018 and reside
in our hometown near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We don't have human children, but
we do have furry children. We have three cats and two dogs.

life, check out the [photos pages](/photos).
