# About Me

## Differentiators

What differentiates Colton is his optimism, willingness to tackle a problem,
notetaking abilities and kindness. Colton is careful with his words and very
aware of how easy it is to destroy a relationship that took a while to build.
Colton believes that trusting relationships are key to success, even with effective
processes. Therefore, he operates with the mindset that relationships are
paramount.

## Career

Colton McCurdy joined [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) in March of 2020 as a
Software Engineer on the Data Infrastructure team. The role has primarily consisted
of helping product teams become more operationally independent. Colton has helped
by building tooling, implementing processes, writing documentation and leading
effective project handoffs.

Previously, Colton worked at [StockX](https://stockx.com/)
where he designed, implemented and maintained many microservices written in Go.
His primary focus was integrating with Google Shopping, which at the time was
a majority of the company's monthly marketing spend (i.e., millions of dollars).
Integrating with Google Shopping was a particularly challenging problem for StockX
due to the nature of StockX's platform --- i.e., highly fluid pricing.
He built and maintained the Google Shopping pipeline for two years before a team
was established to own the pipeline. Colton effectively transfered ownership of
the pipeline, at which point Colton moved to the Infrastructure team.

Prior to joining StockX in May of 2017 as employee number 50 --- approximately
the 5th backend engineer --- Colton completed his B.Sc. in Computer Science at
Allegheny College, where his research focus was in software testing, specifically
analyzing a technique known as mutation testing for evaluating test suite adequacy.

## Personal Interests

Outside of work, Colton's primary interests are traveling, running, reading
and photography. A perfect day for Colton would look like getting up at 5AM, making
a pour-over coffee while reading a book, going for a 10k run and then finishing
the day off going on a short drive with hist wife to photograph Golden hour.
