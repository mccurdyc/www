Ullman starts the book with the following quote,

> People imagine that programming is logical, a process like fixing a clock. Nothing
> could be further from the truth. Programming is more like an illness, a fever, an obsession.
> It's like riding a train and never being able to get off.

Ullman goes on to describe her interactions with technologies of the times and

her experiences as a software engineer. She discusses this notion of "being close
to the machine" --- writing code that is less abstracted from machine-readable code ---
and the individuals that write code that is less abstracted are are quirkier, but
are the ones that are truly respected because people outside of geeky clique can't
understand them.

The Y2K "millenium bug" was not in fact a bug, but rather how systems were designed
prior to save space by storing less information. Updating systems to support the
roll over to 2000, forced engineering teams to understand the real-world effects of
their systems. They were a cog in a larger system. Some companies even identified
ways to "hack" a fix, by resetting the internal clocks of their machines to 1972,
when the dates lined up with those of 2000.

Describes the problem introduced by the amount of data available. Something as simple
as buying a faucet. Prior to the internet, she would have gone to the hardware
store where they would have have a handful of choices, she would have bought one
and been done that day. But the internet offers so many choices that she was never
confident that she had chosen the best option. The task turned into something that
took weeks of research, that was previously completed in one day.

Also the internet further polarizes the thoughts of individuals, because now, they
can dive deeper into the parts of the web that

> Before the advent of the web, if you wanted to sustain a belief in far-fetched
> ideas, you had to go out into the desert, or live on a compound in the mountains...
> But now, without leaving home, from the comfort of your easy chair, you can divorce
> yourself from the consensus of what constitutes "truth".

She discusses an inner battle with the infamous imposter syndrome, when she was offered
a job from her friend's brother, Larry Page. And convinced herself that her self-taught knowledge of
symmetrical multiprocess was not adequate to join the team at Google.

Even the founders of the internet were upset with how it evolved into something
very different from what it was intended

> ... we must find our way back to the technologists' dream of the internet, the
> free exchange among millions of equals; the following of links to links, unobserved...

> The internet had become not a celebration of computing, but a stock-market event, as
> Tim Berners-Lee had feared it would.

Discusses "programming the post-human" and what it means to be human. The post-human
will not appreciate things like chairs that provide comfort after a long day.

> Intelligence, then, is a consequence of our having this particular fleshly form...

But the issue is that

> Our appetites have given way to theirs. Robots aren't becoming us, ...we are becoming
> them.
