## Relationships

One of the points early in the book that Ben said his father taught him is something
challenging for many people who are passionate about their work, that is, remembering
to take time and focus on loved ones and friends.

> Flowers are really cheap. But do you know what is expensive? Divorce.

I don't think that his father was exclusively talking about "cheap" from a financial perspective.
And really I think the point can be boiled down to doing seemingly simple, yet impactful
things for friends and loved ones can mean a lot because when you don't do anything
and don't give any attention to these relationships, they fall apart. Ben talks about
how after this conversation, he had to consider priorities that weren't purely his
own.

> By doing everything, I would fail at the most important thing.

Early in Ben's career, he landed a dream job at a company run by a young Marc Andreessen.
This relationship evolved into what is now one of the most well-recognized technology-focused
venture capital firm, Adreessen Horowitz (known as "a16z"). Their portfolio consists
of companies like airbnb, Digital Ocean, Facebook, GitHub and many, many more well-known
companies. Ben describes why his relationship with Marc has been so successful and
why it is important for everyone to find someone who you can challenge and that
can challenge you and your ideas. But that there has to be a balance between
complacency and intensity, too much of either is not productive.

## Communication and Feedback

Another point that Ben makes in regards to relationships, but more specifically
in communication is the importance of honesty and being able to deliver difficult
messages, clearly. If instead of doing the hard thing --- delivering the message
in a straightforward way --- you give someone a "shit sandwich" (a compliment, followed
by the difficult thing that you really wanted to say, followed by another compliment),
you will confuse whoever you are talking to and won't actually get the
point that you wanted to make across. Ben also mentions the importance of clarity, even
when you don't have a solution to a particular problem.

While on the topic of giving feedback, in chapter 7, there is a section titled "Feedback
is a dialog, not a monologue". In this section, Ben explains that "...your goal should be for
your feedback to open up rather than close down discussion." In code reviews, I've
told my team that when someone gives feedback, that doesn't necessarily mean to do
exactly what the person is proposing or that the person is correct, but that it
is a data point to consider and possibly discuss further if you don't understand, or
disagree. Personally, I have been trying to give feedback that is both actionable
and data-backed. When I do give opinionated feedback, I make it clear that it is
an opinion. On a similar note, work that you have done can and should be iterated
upon; it should not be "dead". You shouldn't be deterred from working on something
because you aren't sure if you have the best solution. Treat it like an experiment.
You probably have a reason for thinking that what you are working on could improve
something --- whether it be a process, safety, etc. --- and if it doesn't, or
if it makes it worse, "undo" it. Your work should start a conversation that needs
to be had and can be iterated upon.

> ...your goal should be for your feedback to open up rather than close down discussion.

## Hiring and Culture

Ben, throughout the book, makes many great points on the topic of hiring and culture.
One of the points that stands out most and if I had to pick just one point from
this book, it would be that there is no such thing as the perfect person for the
position. Or, the perfect person for the position in 18 months. But rather, that
there is only the perfect person for the position at your company, _right now_.
If you hire the person who would be perfect _in_ 18 months, that individuals probably
isn't meeting many peoples' expectation for the challenges that you are facing _right
now_. In 18 months, or even 6 months, you could be a very different company and
the position could have very different responsibilities. If that person is
great for what your company needs in 18 months _from now_ and you got them right now,
first, they may not be as flexible as you need them to be or second, they could
hate the chaos that you are currently facing and end up leaving before
they even experience the company 18 months from now. Conversely, someone who
is great for the position right now may not be great for the position in 18 months.
"...everybody needs to requalify for the new job, because the new job and the old
job are not the same."

Hiring is risky and very difficult. Finding the right person often requires you
to analyze both strengths and weaknesses, but often, we either hire or don't hire
someone because of their weaknesses. Instead, Ben suggests that we focus on someone's
strengths and what they can bring to the company.

Ben describes culture as "designing a way of working". At Amazon, desks being
made out of doors instilled frugality into its employees. While at a16z, respecting
everyone's time was something that they wanted to be part of the culture, so for
every minute late you are to a meeting with an entrepreneur, you pay a $10 fine.
If you were on a very important call and had to be 10 minutes late for the meeting,
fine, but be prepared to pay the $100 fine. Ben ends this chapter describing what
is _not_ culture, but rather (arguably) perks (e.g., yoga classes, bringing your
dog to work, etc.).

## Investing in and Managing Employees

After hiring comes investing in and managing employees as to maximize potential.
What you will find is that after the on-boarding of new employees, they are
"let free" and the training stops there. Ben argues that training is one of the
most important jobs that the CEO of a company can and should do. If the CEO spends
12 hours with 10 employees and each of those employees, who will cumulatively work
for 20,000 hours in the next year, improves by just 1%, that is 200 additional
hours of work gained for 12 hours spent.

Investing in employees should also be done by the managers by having frequent
one-on-ones with employees where performance is evaluated and feedback is given
and received, frequently. Performance should not exclusively be evaluated
quantitatively or qualitative goals are guaranteed to never be met. Evaluating
exclusively qualitatively is "like painting by the numbers --- it's strictly for
amateurs."

> Mangement purely by the numbers is sort of like painting by the numbers --- it's strictly for amateurs.

Ben also mentions the notion of "management debt" which, similar to technical debt,
is "incurred when you make an expedient, short-term management decision with an
expensive long-term consequence". There are three popular types of management debt.

1. Putting two in the box: When it isn't clear to employees who should make the final
decision, so each decision involves twice the cost.

2. Overcompensating a key employee, because [they get] another job offer.

3. No performance management or employee feedback process.

As a manager, you will also have to deal with the "Accountability versus Creativity Paradox".
Do you punish an employee for working on something creative that could help
the company in the future, but that lead to a missed deadline? Ben's answer was
basically, that it depends on the seniority of the individual. If the person has
more experience, then yes, the individual should be held accountable for not
understanding the deadlines and communicating the work or potential deadline shift
properly.

My philosophy on this currently has leaned toward doing the thing that I know adds
value now and will especially add value in the future, but to be consciously aware
of scope creep. You need to know when to stop and when the returns of what you are
working is diminishing. In certain cases, it would be acceptable to "open a ticket and
put it in the backlog", but in others, when I have a clear vision and solution
for a major problem that has a significant impact on the work we are working on,
that is when I suggest doing the work and asking for forgiveness later.

## The Vision

Time and time again, from conversations with people and reading books, I constantly
hear and see the point of market fit and the vision.

> Focus on the road, not the wall

If you focus on what _could_ go wrong, you will drive yourself crazy. "Focus on
where you are going rather than on what you hope to avoid."

Founding father of virtual reality, [Jaron Lanier](http://www.jaronlanier.com/), writes
in the introduction about what "nerdism" is like. Lanier says,

> "Life becomes a problem-solving activity, and the problem is some sort of lack of optimization."

He also mentions that computers have this uncanny ability to create the illusion
that we are all-seeing. This immediately made me think about how social media
has the ability to polarize groups of users, especially in regards to American politics. [This
post](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/is_social_media_driving_political_polarization)
from the Greater Good Magazine, explains that the polarization may be subtler than
we think, but major social media sites are not actively working to "bridge" the
polarized groups, to fix the problem.

As software engineers, we have a lot of power and with that comes a lot of responsibility.
However, sometimes lives or data companies are responsible for is not handled with
the appropriate care. Think of the [recent issues with Boeing's best-selling, 737, planes](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/boeing-readies-software-fix-for-737-max-planes-airlines-prepare-for-longer-disruptions.html)
where the software has actually caused the planes to crash in an attempt to
keep the planes from stalling or the [Equifax breach in 2017](https://www.ftc.gov/equifax-data-breach)
where sensitive personal information of 143 million Americans was exposed. Some
of this could be due to strict deadlines to ship imposed on software engineers or
the lack of understanding or care by engineers about what they are actually building.

Ullman describes the typical thought of how software is created, that is, via a
"black-box", where software is magically produced. "Then it moves to programming."
As software engineers, sometimes we are too caught up in _how_ we build something,
instead of _what_ we are building. Ullman says,

> It has occurred to me that if people really knew how software got written, I'm not
> sure if they'd give their money to a bank or get on am airplane ever again.

Ullman also mentions that in general the culture around building software is to make
money, not to solve "real", social problems. And that when we do build software to
solve social problems, we force users to conform to how we think the problem should
be solved instead of talking to the users of the software. We, as software engineers,
are obsessed with problem solving and therefore think we can come up with a better
solution, sometimes without talking to the end-users.

Software systems force users to conform to a limited set of defined options by the
owners of the systems, e.g., male, female.

> ...the more we surround ourselves with a narrowed notion of existence, the more narrow
> existence becomes. We conform to the range of motion the system allows. We must
> be more orderly, more logical. Answer the question, Yes or No, OK or Cancel.

As software engineers, we take the malfunctioning of software as personal slight,
cursing at the engineers before us who wrote the broken code that we have now
inherited. "How could you be so blind?".

This is something recently that I have talked
about with peers. While a system may be poorly written or buggy --- are you sure it's
a bug and wasn't a feature at that time? --- you have to consider when it was written.
The constraints, the pressures, the discussions and resources available. While
many of these things should be documented, that is not always feasible or seen as
a good use of time when making the decisions. You, as the creator of future loathed
code, need to defend your future self. The blame should not be put entirely on you,
just because you are the name in the commit log.

Something that I have already had to fight with is individuals or groups of individuals
who are attached to a single technology, wanting to use it as a universal solution,
even when there are much better alternatives.

Ullman says when discussing attachment to a single technology, "Don't get comfortable, don't
get too attached, don't get married. Fidelity in technology is not even desirable.
Loyalty to one system if career-death."

Finally, the following paragraph resonated with me, where Ullman describe the life
of a software engineer, we are "never not working".

> Even when I'm not actually doing something that could be called work, I might get
> started any minute. So everything is an interruption --- a call from a friend,
> an invitation to lunch --- everything must be refused because it is possible that
> from one moment to the next I will get back to something.

{{% book title="Life in Code" author="Ellen Ullman" finished="March 05, 2019" amazon="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Code-Personal-History-Technology/dp/1250181690/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=6BC2NWZG60SW5CTFWQMG" thrift="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/life-in-code-a-personal-history-of-technology_ellen-ullman/13998458/all-editions/" %}}

Ullman starts the book with the following quote,

> People imagine that programming is logical, a process like fixing a clock. Nothing
> could be further from the truth. Programming is more like an illness, a fever, an obsession.
> It's like riding a train and never being able to get off.

She goes on to describe her interactions with technologies of the times and
her experiences as a female software engineer in a male-dominated industry. She
discusses this notion of "being close to the machine" --- writing code that is
less abstracted from machine-readable code --- and how that the individuals that write
less abstracted code are respected because they are quirkier. Ellen mentions the
biases and culture that are assumed; the optimizations in every part of life, as
if life is a piece of software (e.g., reducing time spent cooking, etc.).

The internet further polarizes the thoughts of individuals, because now, they
can dive deeper into the parts of the web that they choose.

> Before the advent of the web, if you wanted to sustain a belief in far-fetched
> ideas, you had to go out into the desert, or live on a compound in the mountains...
> But now, without leaving home, from the comfort of your easy chair, you can divorce
> yourself from the consensus of what constitutes "truth".

Even the founders of the internet were upset with how it evolved into something
very different from what it was intended.

> ... we must find our way back to the technologists' dream of the internet, the
> free exchange among millions of equals; the following of links to links, unobserved...

> The internet had become not a celebration of computing, but a stock-market event, as
> Tim Berners-Lee had feared it would.


She discusses an inner battle with the infamous imposter syndrome, when she was offered
a job from her friend's brother, Larry Page of Google. And how she convinced herself
that her self-taught knowledge was not adequate and that she would be revealed as as fraud.

She considers "programming the post-human" and what it truly means to be a fleshy human.
The post-human will not appreciate deceptively simple things such as chairs that
provide comfort for a tired human.

> Intelligence, then, is a consequence of our having this particular fleshly form...

Ullman alludes to the software that makes the pieces of our lives such as dinner and meals
seem like an inconvenience. We are constantly trying to optimize away these important
parts of life that define us as humans.

> Our appetites have given way to theirs. Robots aren't becoming us, ...we are becoming
> them.

Finally, she calls to the general public to learn how to program, not to become
professional programmers, but to loosen the stranglehold of code that surrounds us
to,

> pierce the computing veil; to demystify algorithms; to know that code has
> biases, [and] that programs are written by human beings...

> For the world of programmers is not going to change on its own. Many who enter are
> going to find themselves in the company of ...men who want to humiliate the newcomers,
> ...men who will not or cannot communicate.

But, Ullman urges "outsiders" to penetrate the bubble because there is so much
to be found in yourself and with those encouraging you when you are working
toward getting a piece of software to "just work".

> Yet I must force myself to see the good the young dreamers might do.
> I must hope that those who barely remember life before the internet, or never knew
> it at all, will find their way through the dazzle and disappointments of technology,
> the seductions and the traps.
